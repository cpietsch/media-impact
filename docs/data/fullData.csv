Achondrite
(monomict basaltic eucrite)
A 252 g stone with black shiny
fusion crust was found on March 22 in the roof of a building, in a hole in the
insulating material. Water was first observed leaking from the ceiling inside
the building at 8:30 am on March 18, 2002. The stone had broken into 2
fragments (238.9 g and 13 g) upon impact. Taking into account the local amount
of rainfall in the previous days, the absorption of water by the porous
insulating material and the distance between the hole in the roof and the leak
in the ceiling, leads to an estimate that the fall took place between February
3 and February 14. Mineralogy and classification (M. Bourot-Denise, MNHNP):
low-Ca pyroxene En36Wo3 with lamellae of high-Ca pyroxene
En29.5Wo42.5, and laths of plagioclase An90;
consists of clasts with pyroxene grain size about 100-200 µm, in a matrix of
same texture and composition but smaller grain size (~50-100 µm). Minor phases include chromite (0.3% MgO, 8% Al2O3,
2.6% TiO2, 0.6% MnO), ilmenite (0.4% MgO, 1% MnO), silica, iron
sulfide, Fe-Ni metal. Specimens: type specimen, 130 g, MNHNP; rest of
the mass with finder.

Fall: 7 October 2008, 05:46 h local time (UT+3) 
Achondrite (ureilite, polymict, anomalous) 
History: On October 6, 2008, a small asteroid called 2008 TC3 was discovered by the automated Catalina Sky Survey 1.5 m telescope at Mount Lemmon, Tucson, Arizona, and found to be on a collision course with Earth. Numerous astronomical observatories followed the object until it entered the Earth’s umbra at Oct. 7.076 UTC the next day. The astrometric position of 295 observations of 2008 TC3 over the period Oct. 6.278 to Oct. 7.063 was used to calculate the approach trajectory over the impact location in northern Sudan. The object exploded at a high ~37 km altitude over the Nubian Desert, and as a result the meteorites are spread over a large area. A search was organized by the University of Khartoum on Dec. 2–9, led by P. Jenniskens (SETI Institute) and M. H. Shaddad (Khartoum). 
Physical characteristics: During the first expedition, 15 meteorites were found along the approach path of the asteroid, for a total weight of 563 g. A second field expedition, on Dec. 25–30, added 37 meteorites, for a total recovered weight of 3.95 kg, spread over an area of 28 × 5 km. The meteorites are dark, thinly crusted, and roundish in shape, ranging in size from 1–10 cm. 
Petrography (M. Zolensky, JSC, and A. Steele, CIW): The sample is a fine-grained, fragmental breccia with subrounded mineral fragments and olivine aggregates embedded in a cataclastic matrix of ureilitic material. Mineral fragments include polycrystalline olivine, low-Ca pyroxene, pigeonite and carbon-rich aggregates up to 0.5 mm in maximum dimension, kamacite, and troilite. The examined samples have considerable porosity; the pore walls are commonly coated by anhedral to euhedral crystals of low-Ca pyroxene (Fs2Wo3) and olivine (Fa12–14), and in some instances spherules of kamacite and botryoidal masses of troilite. Most olivine and pyroxene aggregates have interstitial silicates with Si-content that increases adjacent to metal grains. Some clasts consist of rounded pyroxene grains containing an abundant nanophase Fe-rich mineral. Aggregates of carbonaceous material are common and measure up to 0.5 mm—these contain fine-grained troilite and kamacite, the latter containing Si and P. The major carbon phase is graphite. Shock effects are not apparent. 
Mineral compositions and geochemistry: Low–Ca pyroxene: Fs2Wo5-Fs17Wo4, Cr2O3 = 0.33–1.02 wt%; pigeonite: Fs15Wo5-Fs18Wo11, Cr2O3 = 0.72–1.11 wt%), olivine (Fa8–15, CaO = 0.15–0.51 wt%, Cr2O3 = 0.03– 1.58 wt%). Kamacite is Fe0.92Ni0.08-Fe0.96Ni0.04. Troilite contains up to 4.3 wt% Cr. Mineral grains exhibit no zoning. 
Classification: Achondrite (ureilite, polymict, anomalous). Anomalous features include lack of zoning of olivine, large size of carbonaceous aggregates, and overall fine-grained texture. 
Type specimens: Samples with masses ranging from a few to a few hundred grams for a total of 3.95 kg are on deposit at Khartoum.   "

Fall: 15 February 2009; 11:00 AM CST (UT-6)
Ordinary chondrite (L6)
History: On Sunday February 15, 2009 (11:00 A.M. CST), News 8 cameraman Eddie Garcia recorded a fireball 180 km south of downtown Austin, Texas. From SE of Austin to Ft. Worth, many people observed the bolide. Using National Weather Service Doppler reflectivity radar measurements (NWS Ft. Worth and Granger stations) the bolide location was recorded at 11:03 A.M. D. Dawn led a team, which interviewed witnesses in the strewn field within 48 hours following the fall. In southern Hill County, straddling the northern corner of McLennan County, sonic booms were widely heard for a duration of 20–30 s in the area from Hubbard to Aquilla. The fireball was bright and the meteoroid fragmented overhead near Birome, where the sonic booms were reported loudest. In Aquilla, the rumblings were likened to “a jet taking off,” and the event was described at 30–40 degrees altitude in the eastern sky, with some horizontal movement. Strong sonic booms were widely reported from Hubbard and Penelope. J. Trussell heard a rumbling, which initially vibrated a window at about 11:00 A.M. CST. He looked north along Ash Creek and saw two segments of a smoke trail separated by a thick cloud. Shortly afterwards, a blackened stone rolled near his foot and a second impacted a shed behind him. Meteorites were found on February 17 by D. Sadilenko and D. Dawn on the banks Ash Creek, northern corner of McLennan County. 
Physical Characteristics: Three large masses were found: a 1.7 kg specimen recovered by L.B. Etter on a farm in Menlow; a 1.673 kg stone purchased by meteorite dealer S. Arnold; and a 1.5 kg specimen purchased by M. Farmer from an anonymous landowner who suggested it was found in the vicinity of Aquilla. All other masses reported were less than 300 g each. According to reports, over 300 stones were found in McLennan and Hill Counties with an estimated total of over 11.7 kg. Approximately 75% of the finds were completely covered with thick black fusion crust, often with dark rust colored spots, even on specimens recovered within two days of the fall. Drizzle and heavy dew wet specimens in the strewn field for the first two nights following the fall, and heavy rain on March 13 soaked the area, oxidizing many specimens. Broken and cut surfaces reveal a dark/light gray breccia. 
Petrography (A. Rubin, UCLA): Many plagioclase grains exceed 50 μm in size. Some metal grains contain irregular troilite inclusions. Metallic Cu is present in some metal. Metal- and sulfide-bearing shock veins are present and the meteorite exhibits silicate darkening. 
Mineral Compositions (A. Rubin, UCLA): Olivine (Fa24.2 ± 0.2; n = 12), low-Ca pyroxene (Fs20.5 ± 0.7, Wo1.6 ± 0.2; n = 12). Taenite is more abundant than kamacite; average compositions: kamacite (Fe = 93.1%, Ni = 5.8%, Co = 0.83%; n = 4) and taenite (Fe = 69.6%, Ni = 30.3%, Co = 0.30%; n = 9). 
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (L6) breccia; S3, W0. Type Specimen: 30.91 g is at UCLA including a crusted 17.8 g piece, a 10.02 g end cut and a 3.09 g slice. M. Farmer holds 1.5 kg, D. Stimpson purchased Etter’s 1.7 kg mass; and the 1.673 kg mass was sliced and sold.  "

Fall: 16 October 2006; 04:00 UTC
Ordinary chondrite (H5) 
History: A fireball was witnessed in the area, but no records of the direction of movement were recorded. A single stone of 3165 g was found by A. Salem El Moichine, a local resident, on the same day at 13:00 hr local time, 11 km SE of Bassikounou. The sample for classification was provided to NMBE by M. Ould Mounir, Nouakchott, who obtained it from his cousin who recovered the meteorite. According to S. Buhl (Hamburg, Germany), more than 20 specimens were later recovered by locals and meteorite finders. These finds define a 8 km long strewnfield. The total recovered mass is 46.00 kg. 
Physical characteristics: The 3165 g specimen is largely covered by black fusion crust. The interior is light gray. On the surface of the fusion crust there is some adherent soil material, some of which is bright red. Shortly after recovery, the stone was cut into two pieces of 1200 and 1950 g. The larger piece has a rectangular shape and shows indications of flow-lines in the fusion crust.
Petrography: (E. Gnos, MHNGE; B. Hofmann, NMBE, M. Eggimann, Bern/NMBE): Mean chondrule size 0.35 mm (n=53). Metal abundance is 8 vol%, troilite 6.6 vol%. Mean plagioclase grain size is ~20 mm. Troilite is polycrystalline, rich in silicate inclusions, and shows diffuse boundaries to metal. Metal is partly rich in silicate- and troilite inclusions. Rare metallic Cu (10 mm) occurs at kamacite-taenite boundaries and in troilite. Some shock veins and no weathering products were observed.
Mineral compositions: Olivine (Fa18.6), pyroxene (Fs16.3 Wo1.1), plagioclase (An13.7).
Cosmogenic radionuclides: (P. Weber, PPGUN) Gamma-spectroscopy performed in December-January 2006 showed the presence of the following radionuclides: 48V, 46Sc, 56Co, 54Mn, 58Co, 7Be, 51Cr, 57Co, 22Na, 26Al and 60Co. Recalculated to 12 October 2006 22Na was 38.0±2.2 and 26Al 31.5±2.1 (both dpm/kg), the activity ratio of 1.21 is fully consistent with a fall on that date.
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (H5); S2, W0.
Type specimens: A total of 115 g are on deposit at NMBE. Boudreaux holds the main mass."

Humboldt County, Nevada, USAFell: 2012 Aug 22 06:17 (UTC)
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (L6)
History: The fall was observed in weather radar imagery from the US NEXRAD radar network,  operated by the US National Weather Service. The discovery and analysis was done by Dr. Marc Fries, Galactic Analytics LLC. The KLRX radar in Elko, Nevada, is approximately 33 km from the fall site and recorded the fall in eight radar sweeps between 0619.26 UTC and 0621.03 UTC. This time span of 97 s is short compared to other meteorite falls observed by radar. This could be a result of meteorite production by a single, large breakup event, by relatively little fragmentation, or a combination of the two factors. The first stone was found on September 1, 2012, 10:50 AM (PDT) by Robert Verish; it weighs 19.25 g.  As of 3 Oct 2012, at least 23 stones with a total mass of ~2.9 kg have been reported.
Physical characteristics: Most stones have a similar appearance, with a blocky shape where corners are not well-rounded; where orientation is exhibited, it is poorly developed.  Regmaglypts are smaller than thumb-sized.  Fusion-crust is uniformly distributed but thin, and on some sides of several stones displays a brownish patina on an otherwise uniformly black surface.
Petrography: (Alan Rubin, UCLA):  The stone is recrystallized with 50-μm-size plagioclase grains.  Olivine grains exhibit weak mosaicism; many chromite grains are extensively fractured. Troilite grains commonly polycrystalline.  There has been localized melting of metal and sulfide.  Several grains of metallic Cu occur inside metal at the boundaries of small (apparently melted) irregularly shaped troilite grains.
Geochemistry: Ca-pyroxene Fs7.8Wo43.7 (n=2); low-Ca pyroxene Fs19.8±0.2Wo1.3±0.3%  (n=22)
Classification: Ordinary Chondrite (L6), grains are extensively fractured - moderately shocked (S4), unweathered (W0).
Specimens: An endcut of the 19.25 g stone found Sept. 1 was thin-sectioned and classified by UCLA. A slice from this stone of 3.85 g (20%) is held by UCLA.  Another stone (56.5 g) was found in 3 pieces and is held by the finder, Martin Cunningham, Battle Mountain, Nevada.  The finder donated one of the 3 pieces to UCLA which makes a total of 46 g type specimen.  The second find from this fall (954 g) is held by Robert Ward, who purchased it from the finder. This stone is the largest mass recovered to date.

ReVelle (Los Alamos National Laboratory). A crude analysis of recorded infrasound data suggests a 0.01 kT event as analyzed by Peter Brown and Wayne Edwards (University of Western Ontario, Canada). The event occurred nearby the Argentina-Uruguay border. Eyewitnesses, interviewed by members of AEA and Gonzalo Tancredi (DAFC), reported that the fireball traveled from west to east and experienced several fragmentations along its trajectory causing audible detonations that shattered buildings in the area of fall. Several stones were found by members of Asociación Astronómica Entre Ríos a few days after the fall in the countryside around Colonia Berduc. The largest piece is a 154-g sample located in MNCNA-AS that acts as the hosting institution. The MLEDU museum has a 95-g piece, and CASLEO has a piece of 21 g. The rest of the mass remaining in Argentina is in private collections.Physical characteristics: The known stones exhibit a fresh black fusion crust; total recovered mass remaining in Argentina ≈ 737 g. Other pieces were collected or bought by dealers and sold in the U.S., so the total mass was probably higher. To avoid Argentina regulations we know that some pieces have been sold under the name “Arroyo Malo”. Several expeditions leaded by Gonzalo Tancredi and Leda Sanchez (DAFC) to that region ruled out the possibility that these pieces were found in that locality of the nearby Uruguay.Petrography and mineral compositions: (Alan Rubin, UCLA; Jordi Llorca, UPC; Josep M. Trigo-Rodríguez, CSIC-IEEC) Olivine (Fa 23.7±0.5; n=23), low-Ca pyroxene (Fs20.3±0.5 Wo1.4±0.2; n=25) and kamacite (7.1±0.8 mg/g Co; n=7). Berduc contains 8.1 wt.% metallic Fe-Ni. Classification: The modal abundance of metallic Fe-Ni and the mean olivine, low-Ca pyroxene and kamacite compositions of Berduc indicate that the rock is an L-group chondrite. Berduc is highly recrystallized and contains poorly defined radial pyroxene (RP), porphyritic olivine (PO), porphyritic olivine-pyroxene (POP), and barred olivine (BO) chondrules that are well integrated into the matrix.  Plagioclase grains typically exceed 50 µm in size, indicating that the rock is petrologic type 6. This is consistent with the relative compositional homogeneity of the olivine and low-Ca pyroxene. Metallic Fe-Ni grains show no signs of alteration, consistent with weathering grade W0. The rock has been moderately shocked, equivalent to shock-stage S4; many of the olivine grains contain planar fractures and exhibit weak mosaic extinction.  Specimens: Types specimens, 154 g MNCNA-AS, 2 g UCLA and 5 g CSIC. Most of the remaining material has been sold to private collectors."

Fall: 5 October 2004, ~13:30 local daylight time (UT-6) 
Achondrite (eucrite) 
History: A meteorite fell ~4 km east of Berthoud, Colorado. According to information from those who visited the site, Megan and Andy Clifford “had just walked out of their house when they were distracted by whistling noise and a thump. Megan observed some dust kicked up in a horse pen about 100 feet away. After a short search, they recovered the object.” (http://www.cloudbait.com/science/bermet.html). The meteorite embedded itself a few inches below the surface. 
Physical characteristics: A single stone, 120 mm across, ~960 g was recovered soon after the fall. Fresh, glossy, black fusion crust covered the stone except for a small broken corner. The interior is medium gray in color. 
Petrography: (D. H. Hill, UAz) Overall, texture is ophitic to subophitic with evidence of brecciation and recrystallization. The meteorite is shocked with occurrences of dislocated grains; fine melt veins run through the sample. Exsolution is observed in pyroxenes; several exhibit finely spaced fractures. Plagioclase contains many blebby inclusions. Accessory minerals include chromite, phosphates, iron sulfides, ilmenite, and silica. 
Mineral compositions and geochemistry: (M. Killgore, UAz) Opx (Fs54.03En42.82Wo3.15); Cpx (Fs31.21En35.80Wo33.00); Plag (An82.72Ab16.04Or1.24); pyroxene molar Fe/Mn = 31. Oxygen isotopes (R. Greenwood, I. Franchi, OU) δ17O = 1.58‰; δ18O = 3.46‰; Δ17O = -0.227‰. 
Classification: Achondrite (eucrite) 
Type specimens: A total sample mass of 24.3 g and one thin section are on deposit at UA; owners hold the main mass; several thin sections with anonymous persons. "

Ordinary chondrite (LL6)
History: A woman witnessed a single stone fall near
Bhawad village, Rajasthan, India. No fireball was seen.
Physical characteristics: The crusted 11 × 6 × 7 cm
stone weighs 678 g, and shows well-developed regmaglypts. Fusion crust is
thinner over an irregular surface at one end, suggesting the stone broke up
during passage through the atmosphere.
Petrography: (N. Bhandari, PRL) Chondrules are
poorly preserved with ill-defined rims. Overall, the texture indicates a high
degree of recrystallization.
Mineral compositions and geochemistry: (N. Bhandari, PRL)
Olivine (Fa28), pyroxene (Fs23). Cosmogenic nuclides indicate the meteoroid
had a pre-atmospheric radius of ~7.5 cm. Cosmic-ray exposure age, 16.3 ± 2.5
Ma.
Type specimen: The stone is located at the PRL.

Circumstances of fall: While listening to a radio program on a summer night in 1938, Reverend Luther Cox and his family heard a noise on the back porch. The next morning he found a ""rock"" which had split into two pieces on impact. His young son, Henry, placed these pieces in his rock collection. In later years the now Reverend Henry Cox has exhibited them at numerous summer camps as possible meteorites. On November 16, 1973, he brought them to Dr. H. Nelson, director of the John Deere Planetarium, who identified them as genuine. On December 1, 1973, Dr. Edward Olsen of the Field Museum, Chicago, was given a small piece and prepared a polished section and subsequently conducted a microprobe and microscope study to determine the petrographic group.

Classification: Ordinary chondrite (L6)
History: A bright bolide was observed descending from the SSW by many eyewitnesses in the departments of Gorgol and Assaba. South of Bou Mdeid an explosion was heard, causing panic among the local population. Witnesses reported a terminal fragmentation of the fireball, sonic booms and hissing sounds. One mass was observed to impact and recovered the following morning. Agence Nouakchott d’Information issued a report on the event, S. Buhl published eye witness accounts recorded by C. Toueirjenne.
Physical characteristics: The stone is light gray with a black fusion crust. Some chondrules are visible on broken surface, and some rusty spots.
Petrography: A brecciated texture is evident in thin section, all components being of type L6. Strongly recrystallized texture. Feldspar grain size to 100 μm. Opaque phases include kamacite, taenite, troilite, chromite, ilmenite, and rare native copper. A single Cr-Al-rich chondrule (1.0 mm) with plagioclase (An25), spinel-chromite solid solution, ilmenite-geikielite and micron-sized baddeleyite is present in the analyzed thin section.
Geochemistry: Olivine has mean composition of Fa23.9±0.5 (identical value confirmed by XRD), pyroxene Fs20.2±0.4Wo1.6±0.3. Cosmogenic radionuclides (M. Laubenstein, Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Italy): Gamma-ray spectroscopy conducted 84 days after the fall showed the presence of short-lived isotopes (7Be, 58Co, 56Co, 46Sc), consistent with a recent fall. Data for 60Co, 54Mn and 22Na indicate a pre-atmospheric radius of 10-20 cm.

BREITSHEID
The place
of fall or discovery: φ = 50°40'.1 N;  λ = 8°11'.1E.  near the
small town of Breitsheid, 8 km to the west of Heiborn, Dill district, Hessen, West Ger­many.
Date of
fall or discovery: 11 August 1956, between 15:30 and 15:45 European mean
time.
Class and
type: stone, meteorite, light grey chondrit.
The number
of separate specimens: 1 (?); it measures 5 x 10 x 15 cm.
Total
weight: the initial total weight is assumed to be some what less than 1 kg.
The
circumstances of the fall or discovery: the fall of the meteorite was
observed as a short, light yellow, somewhat reddish fiery trail. Judging by the
broken branches of trees and the aspect of the hole, it may be concluded that
the meteorite fell from west to east at an angle of 45°. During the fall, sounds
were heard resembling a locomo­tive letting out steam. No crash was heard. The
meteorite was found 30 min. after its fall. The person who discovered the stone
thought it must have fallen from an aeroplane that had recently flown past and
that it was of no scientific value whatever. The meteorite remained warm for a
long time. As a result of striking a stone in the ground the meteorite must
have broken into 14 pieces at least.
At the end of
September the fall of the meteorite became known at the Max-Plank-Institute (Mainz, W.G.) of Chemisry. Measures were taken to collect the fragments that it was still
possible to find. 
Judging by
the fragments and also by the depth of the hole it may be concluded that the
initial weight of the stone must have been somewhat less than 1 kg.
The fall of
the meteorite was seen by Mrs. Reich (who was standing 45 metres from the spot
where it fell), Mr. Reich, Mrs. Fork and Mr. Zenzin­ger. Günter Thielmann took
care of the meteorite and reported the fall.
According to
G. Thielmann the chemical composition of the meteorite is as follows:
SiO2,
40.83 %; MgO,  27.17 %; CaO,  2.21%; Al2O3, 1.04 %; TiO2,
 0.30 %; Fe,  20.78 %; Ni,  1.69 %; Co, 0.37 %; Mn,  0.33 %; P,  0.20 %; C,  0.37
%; S, 2.12 %.
The main mass
of the meteorite is in the Max-Plank-Institute of Che­mistry, where chemical, radiochemical
and petrographical investigations are being made. The results of the
investigations will be published in ""Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta"".

One stone, weighing 5.3 kg, fell in a field, 15 km
away from the Bukhara city. A shepherd saw the fall and recovered the stone.
Later his grandson learned about meteorites in school and remembered about the
stone. He thought that it might be a meteorite, and reported about the stone to
the Ulugh Beg Astronomical Institute of the Uzbek Academy of Sciences. Shuhrat
A. Ehgamberdiev of the Institute sent a sample of the meteorite to the Vernadsky
Institute in 2004. Mineralogy and classification (M.A. Ivanova Vernad., F.
Brandstaetter NHMW). Fusion crust is well developed, dark gray. The
meteorite consists of POP, PO, BO and PP chondrules, chondrule fragments, CAIs,
and matrix. Matrix/chondrule ratio is 0.6; chondrule sizes vary from 0.2 to 2
mm, 0.6 mm in average. Chondrules of type I are most abundant. Minor phases are
plagioclase, nepheline, jadeite, kamacite (Ni – 5.4 wt%, Co – 0.09 wt%),
taenite (up to 47 wt% Ni), sulfides, mostly troilite.  Olivine, Fa0.9-60;

Fall: 21 July 2007 04:43:56 local time (UT + 9:30) 
Achondrite (eucrite) 
History: A bright fireball was recorded over southwestern Australia by observatories of the Desert Fireball Network. A fall position was pinpointed by triangulation, and a search was mounted. Fragments were recovered within 100 m of the predicted fall site. 
Physical characteristics: Two specimens with a total mass 324 grams were recovered: one 150 g fragment; one 174 g fragment. The smaller is an oriented stone, discus-shaped, and completely fusion crusted. The larger is ~90% fusion crusted, and more irregular in form. The small internal area that is exposed on the second stone is pale grey in color. Fusion crust on both stones is bright, shiny, and fresh. 
Petrography (G. K. Benedix NHM; P. A. Bland ICL): The meteorite is a basaltic eucrite monomict breccia with the majority of the sample exhibiting subophitic texture. Fine-grained clasts are irregularly distributed throughout the sample. The sample contains mm-sized orthopyroxene and plagioclase. Low-Ca pyroxene contains thin exsolution lamellae of Ca-rich pyroxene. The meteorite also contains silica and minor ilmenite. 
Mineral compositions: Pyroxene, Fs62.5Wo3.6 (Fe/Mn-31.1) with augite (Fs27.7Wo43.0) lamellae; plagioclase, An84.1 to An88.2. 
Classification: Achondrite (eucrite) minimal shock and no weathering. 
Type specimens: Both stones (main mass) and one thin section are on deposit at WAM. "

Wilton Rural Municipality, Saskatchewan, Canada 
Fall: 20 November 2008; 17:26:45 MST (UT + 7) 
Ordinary chondrite (H4) 
History: A bright fireball was widely observed across Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba during late twilight on November 20, 2008. The fireball and subsequent dust trail, or shadows cast by the fireball, were recorded by all-sky and security video cameras establishing that its brightest portion occurred from 17:26:40 to 17:26:45 MST. The fireball traveled approximately north to south with an elevation angle of ~60°. Abundant sonic phenomena were reported including anomalous sounds, explosion booms, sonic booms from individual fragments and whirring sounds interpreted as produced by individual fragments falling to ground; the fireball’s explosions were also widely recorded by Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty infrasound stations establishing an energy release of approximately one third of a kiloton, indicating an original meteoroid mass of ~10 tons. Interviews of eyewitnesses and crude calibrations of security cameras constrained the fall region and the first search attempt led to meteorites being recovered off the ice of a manmade pond late on November 27, 2008. Subsequent searches led to recovery of more than one hundred individual fragments before December 6 when increasing snow cover made further searching unproductive. A strewn field at least seven kilometers long and approximately three km wide with a wind drift tail of an additional three km eastwards has been crudely outlined. 
Physical characteristics: A total of 129 well-substantiated pieces totaling ~41 kg have been recovered, but dozens of additional recovered specimens are indicated. The meteorites are distinguished by the large number of specimens with immature ablation surfaces (angular shapes with numerous small piezoglypts); up-range in the strewn field a larger proportion of mature ablation surfaces and oriented individuals are found. The fusion crust is a typical dark gray for an ordinary chondrite fall. The fall is also distinguished by the large proportion of meteorites that exhibit freshly broken surfaces with no fusion crust; broken surfaces with variable amounts of “painting” by fusion crust are also common. 
Petrography (M. Hutson and A. Ruzicka, Cascadia; E. Milley and A. Hildebrand, UCalg): Most surfaces show no brecciation, but one surface has a slightly lighter gray angular clast in a uniform gray matrix. Two different chondrite textures are visible in one thin section, but boundaries between the two regions are indistinct. One area has welldefined chondrules. The other region has more opaques with fewer easily visible chondrules, but has numerous smaller cryptocrystalline chondrules and chondrule fragments. Another section contains a light colored, coarse grained, pyroxene-rich inclusion with an igneous texture. 
Mineral compositions and geochemistry: Olivine (Fa17.8 ± 0.3) with PMD Fa = 1.3, low-Ca pyroxene (Fs16.6 ± 0.8, Wo1.87 ± 0.8) with PMD Fs = 3.9, high-Ca pyroxene (Fs12.4 ± 3.3, Wo20.1 ± 11.2). The composition of high-Ca pyroxene is suggestive of pigeonite, but may be an intimate mixture of low- and high- Ca pyroxene. 
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (H4), S2, W0. 
Type specimens: A mass of 39.1 g and two thin sections are on deposit at UCalg. The strewn field is almost all private land so that much of the meteorite mass is currently owned by private individuals; specimens totaling >1 kg include ~13 kg, 6.99 kg, 1.607 kg, 1.306 kg, 1.201 kg, and 1.082 kg; three of these specimens were recovered during searches organized by UCalg and collaborating institutions.

Ordinary chondrite (H/L4)
History: A bright bolide of absolute magnitude -15 ± 5 was widely seen over Colombia, but mainly over several municipalities of the Cauca Valley. Eyewitnesses reported that the fireball traveled from north to south and experienced several fragmentations along its trajectory, causing audible detonations that shattered windows in the town of Restrepo. Acoustic waves were recorded by OSSO. Ten stones were found in the southern part of Cali (Mariano Ramos, Ciudad Cordoba, Antonio Narino, and Laureano Gómez districts), seven of which had penetrated roofs of houses. Two stones (#5, 6) were found by EAC and ASAFI, and the others were purchased by Farmer and other collectors. There have been unsubstantiated reports of additional stones being collected. Stones #1, 2, 3, 4, and 10 were collected immediately after the fall; the others were exposed to weather for days (#5, 6, 7) to weeks (#8, 9).
Physical characteristics: The known stones have the following masses: #1 = 76.6 g; #2 ˜ 33 g (not including part that was lost); #3 = 37.9 g; #4 = 111 g; #5 = 12 g; #6 = 20 g; #7 = 24.9 g; #8 = 66.7 g; #9 = 90.4 g; #10 = 5.6 g; total recovered mass ˜478 g. All specimens exhibit a fresh black fusion crust.
Petrography and Mineral compositions: (Jordi Llorca, UPC; Josép M. Trigo-Rodríguez, CSIC-IEEC; Alan Rubin, UCLA; Jeff Grossman, USGS) Olivine: Fa22.4±0.3, n = 20 [UCLA], Fa22.5, n = 93, PMDFa = 4% [USGS]. Low-Ca pyroxene: Fs12.1±5.9Wo0.79±0.81, n = 24 [UCLA], Fs15.8Wo1.3, n = 61, PMDFs = 35% [USGS]. Plagioclase: Ab82.5Or1.9, n = 6 [UCLA]. Metal is mainly present as kamacite with 0.66 wt% Co, n = 10 [UCLA]. Metallic Cu grains are common in metal-sulfide assemblages.
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (H/L4); S3, W0. Olivine and kamacite compositions are intermediate between H and L. Olivine is equilibrated, but low-Ca pyroxene is very heterogeneous. Specimens: Type specimens, 20.5 g (stone #9) SI, 2 g UCLA and 2 g CSIC (both from stone #6). Other specimens, 20 g PUJC, 132 g, Farmer. Most of the remaining material has been sold to private collectors.

Fall: 15 September 2007, ~16: 45 UTC
Ordinary chondrite (H4-5)
History: A large fireball was witnessed to impact near the community of Carancas, in the province of Chucuito, region of Puno in the country of Peru. It made a sizable impact crater, ~13.8 m in diameter (INGEMMET) or 11-12 m (L. Jackson, CGS). Local residents and many others have recovered numerous pieces of the impactor from the sides of the crater and the surrounding area. Mike Farmer brought several samples to the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory of the UAz for classification on October 5, 2007. The total mass is currently unknown. A preliminary report was published on the web by F. Luisa Macedo and O. José Macharé of INGEMMET, Peru.
Physical characteristics: Most specimens are without fusion crust and have a gray color with some metal and chondrules visible, although the chondrules are not easily observed. At least one specimen had two different lithologies, the second white in color, indicating it is a breccia. Numerous black shock veins, often on more than one face of a specimen, were observed. At least one large (~2 cm) metal grain was also recovered, with a thin layer of stone attached to it.
Petrography: (H. Connolly, KCCU, UAz; D. Hill, UAz, D. Schrader, UAz, K. Domanik, UAz, and D. Lauretta, UAz). One polished butt and one thin section, of two different samples, were examined. The polished butt contains some relict chondrules with well-defined margins and many textural types present. The thin section shows the rock to have experienced extensive recrystallization of the matrix with few relict chondrules present. Relict chondrules range in size from ~170 µm to 1 mm. Olivine and orthopyroxene were observed with abundant Fe, Ni-metal and Fe-rich sulfide.
Mineral compositions: Olivine (Fa18.4±0.5) and pyroxene (Fs16.1±0.2). Oxygen isotopes: (R. Greenwood, OU; two analyses) δ17O = 3.017, 2.942; δ 18O = 4.519, 4.344; Δ17O = 0.667, 0.683 (all ‰).
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (H4-5); W0, S3.
Type specimens: A total of 22 g, including 5 thin sections, are on deposit at UAz. Farmer holds 320 g.

Chelyabinskaya oblast’, RussiaFell: 15 Feb 2013; 3:22 UT
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (LL5)
History: At 9:22 a.m. (local time) on February 15, 2013, a bright fireball was seen by numerous residents in parts of the Kurgan, Tyumen, Ekaterinburg and Chelyabinsk districts. Images of the fireball were captured by many video cameras, especially in Chelyabinsk. Residents of the Chelyabinsk district heard the sound of a large explosion. The impact wave destroyed many windows in Chelyabinsk and surrounding cities. Many people were wounded by glass fragments. A part of the roof and a wall of a zinc plant and a stadium in Chelyabinsk were also damaged. Numerous (thousands) stones fell as a shower around Pervomaiskoe, Deputatsky and Yemanzhelinka villages ~40 km S of Chelyabinsk. The meteorite pieces were recovered and collected out of snow by local people immediately after the explosion. The snow cover was about 0.7 m deep. The falling stones formed holes surrounded by firn snow. Largest stones reached the frozen soil. A stone may have broken the ice of  Chebarkul Lake, located 70 km W of Chelyabinsk. Small meteorite fragments were found around the 8 m hole in the ice but divers did not find any stones on the lake bottom.
Physical characteristics: The meteorite stones and fragments are from <1 g to 1.8 kg in weight and from a few mm to 10 cm (mainly 3-6 cm) in size. The total mass collected by local people is certainly >100 kg and perhaps > 500 kg. Fusion crusted stones are common. The fusion crust is black or brown and fresh. Broken fragments are rare. The interior of the stones is fresh but in some pieces there is evidence for weak oxidation of metal grains.
Petrography: (D.D. Badyukov and M.A. Nazarov, Vernad). The majority (2/3) of the stones are composed of a light-colored lithology with a typical chondritic texture. Chondrules (~63%) are readily delineated and set within a fragmental matrix. The mean chondrule diameter is 0.93 mm. The chondrule glass is devitrified. The main phases are olivine and orthopyroxene. Olivine shows mosaicism and planar fractures. Rare grains of augite and clinobronzite are present. Small and rare feldspar grains show undulutory extinction, planar deformation features, and are partly isotropic. Troilite (4 vol.%) and FeNi metal (1.3 vol.%) occur as irregularly shaped grains. Accessory minerals are chromite, ilmenite, and Cl-apatite. A significant portion (1/3) of the stones consist of a dark, fine-grained impact melt containing mineral and chondrule fragments. Feldspar is well developed and practically isotropic. No high-pressure phases were found in the impact melt. There are black-colored thin shock veins in both light and dark lithologies.
Geochemistry: (M.A. Nazarov, N.N. Kononkova, and I.V. Kubrakova, Vernad). Mineral chemistry: Olivine Fa 27.9±0.35, N=22; orthopyroxene Fs22.8±0.8Wo1.30±0.26, N=17; feldspar Ab86; chromite Fe/Fe+Mg=0.90, Cr/Cr+Al=0.85 (at.%). Major element composition of the light lithology (XRF, ICP-AS, wt%): Si=18.3, Ti=0.053, Al=1.12, Cr=0.40, Fe=19.8, Mn=0.26, Ca=1.43, Na=0.74, K=0.11, P=0.10, Ni=1.06, Co=0.046, S=1.7. Atomic ratios of Zn/Mn × 100=1.3, Al/Mn=8.8. The impact melt lithology has almost the same composition but it is distinctly higher in Ni, Zn, Cu, Mo, Cd, W, Re, Pb, Bi (ICP-MS).
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (LL5), shock stage S4, weathering W0.
Specimens: About 400 stones weighing 3.5 kg in total and a few thin sections are in Vernad.

Fall: 2 or 3 July 2007, daytime 
Ordinary chondrite (H5) 
History: In fall and winter, 2007 ~100 kg of meteorites were collected in the Erg Chech, north of Taoudenni. Nomads reported the stones fell after a smoke cloud was seen and several detonations were heard over a wide area during daytime in July 2007. The finder of the first meteorites was Mr Ouled Bleila, who died in a car accident on his way back from the trip to the Chergach strewn field in October 2007. According to the Tuareg people from Algeria who visited the fall site in September 2007, the elliptical strewn field stretches for more than 20 km in a northeasterly direction. No fireball was reported. 
Physical characteristics: A large number of fusion-crusted stones have been recovered, the largest ones are 17.8 and 13.9 kg, the smallest ones about 1.5 g. Total known weight ~100 kg. 
Petrography: (E. Gnos, MHNGE; B. Hofmann, NMBE, M. Eggimann, UBE/NMBE) Mean chondrule size is 0.38 mm (n = 61). Mean size of plagioclase grains is ~20 μm. Troilite is polycrystalline, rich in silicate inclusions, and shows diffuse boundaries to metal. Some metal is rich in silicate- and troilite inclusions. No Cu metal observed. Shock stage is S3, some shock veins are visible, no weathering (W0). In addition to this dominant lithology, a significant number of stones consist of chondritic clasts (H5 S3-4 W0, identical to the homogeneous lithology) set in a fine-grained, black, silicate impact melt matrix with abundant droplets of metal and metal-troilite. Shock stage of small clasts is up to S4. 
Mineral compositions and geochemistry: Olivine Fa18.2 (chondrite fragments in impact melt are Fa18.4), pyroxene Fs15.5 Wo1.2 (fragments in impact melt are Fs16.0, Wo1.4). 
Cosmogenic radionuclides: (Patrick Weber, Particle Physics Group, Institute of Physics, University of Neuchâtel) Gamma-spectroscopy performed in November, 2007 showed the presence of the following short-lived radionuclides: 46Sc, 56Co, 54Mn, 58Co, 7Be, 57Co, 22Na, 60Co, 26Al. Recalculated to July, 2007, 22Na was 44.0 ± 1.1 dpm/kg and 26Al 20.8 ± 0.8 dpm/kg. The 22Na/26Al activity ratio of 2.1 is consistent with a fall in July, 2007 and demonstrates that this material is not identical with Bassikounou. 
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (H5), some stones suggest an H impact melt breccia. S3, W0. 
Type specimens and distribution: 115 g at NMBE; 17.8 kg P. Hermann, Canada; 13.9 kg D. Gheesling, USA; 4.9 kg S. Buhl, Germany.

Ordinary Chondrite (H3-5 regolith breccia) 
History: Many persons from Bodrum, Milas and Didim cities heard an enormous explosion followed by dozens of sounds like gunshots, several in a short interval. Other people as far as 200 km from Didim saw a fireball indicating that the meteorite fell in a southerly direction in the vicinity of the southwestern coastline on the Aegean Sea. Many rocks probably fell into the sea. One (D1) weighing about 500 g fell about ten meters from Mr Abdullah Aritürk at Yesilkent, a small district of Didim. He kept about half of it and gave 210 g to Prof. Mehmet Emin Özel of Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University, Physics Department. Two other samples (D2 = 846 g and D3 = 2340 g) were found one after the other by Mr Hayati Ertugrul and collected by Ms Özlem Kocahan, PhD student, and Prof. Özel. Two small pieces of D1 and D2 were brought to the MNHN in Paris by Mr Mesut Kasikci, the only Turkish collector, living in France, who first informed academic research institutions of the recent fall. 
Physical characteristics: All three samples (total mass: 3396 g) were totally covered by a thin black fusion crust. 
Petrography: (Catherine Caillet Komorowski, MNHNP) Breccia showing a mixture of sub-millimeter to centimeter size H5 white clasts in a dark H3 host. D1 sample exhibits exclusively the H5 texture with little matrix and poorly defined chondrules. Opaque phases represent about 9.5 vol% and rare copper occurs in Ni-rich metal at the interface with sulfide in the H5 part. D2 sample exhibits both H5 (observed in D1 sample) and H3 lithologies. In the unequilibrated H3 part, opaque phases represent 12 vol%. Metal is much more abundant than sulfide and is located in and around the chondrules. Chondrules are small, in some cases less than 0.2 mm. Many olivine porphyritic chondrules and some large olivine crystals (0.5 mm) are present in a fine-grained matrix. Numerous chondrules contain luminescent forsterite. Silica-bearing, spinel-rich, chromite and glassy chondrules were found in addition to banded clasts and broken chondrules which both can contain pure enstatite associated with fine-grained metal. No CAIs were found. 
Mineral compositions: EMPA of olivine and pyroxene crystals indicate a rather homogeneous composition in the white lithology (Fa19–20, Fs17–19) and a quite variable composition in the darker lithology of the meteorite where about one third of the chondrules and clasts contain almost pure forsterite and enstatite compositions. In this type 3 lithology Fo ranges from 67 to 100% and En ranges from 70 to 99%. 
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (H3-5); S2, W0. 
Type specimens: Two samples (total mass of 31.6 grams), one polished thin section of D1 and one polished section of D2 are on deposit at MNHNP. Another sample of D3 will soon be deposited at MNHNP. Main masses are kept at Çanakkale University, Turkey (CanaU). A sample of D3 belongs to a private collector, Mesut Kasikçi."

Circumstances of fall: Explosions, variously described as eight distinct explosions, a series of crackling explosions, three explosions and a series of staccato reports, accompanied disintegration of the meteorite over southwest Swaziland. The descent of fragments was marked by a high pitched whine. All three fragments recovered are hard aerolite, similar in appearance and distinctly magnetic. They are irregular in shape but smooth surfaced with characteristic rounded indentations. Overall black-brown crusting with an irregular pattern of cracks is common to all three. The two smaller fragments were fractured and broken on impact and display disseminated sulfide. Specimen A was found buried in moist soil with its lowermost surface at a depth of 18 cm below groundlevel. Specimen B was buried to a similar depth in moist soil in a ploughed field. Specimen C was buried at an estimated depth of 15 cm in moist, pebbly soil on a boulder strewn hillside. It is estimated that 20% of Specimen C was splintered off on impact and was scattered as variously sized chips, only a few of which were recovered. All three specimens had been dug out before the sites were visited. It would appear that the directions of descent were vertical or near vertical.

The
circumstances of the fall or discovery: The movement of the stones from
west to east was he­ard. The sound resembled that of thunder accompa­nied by a
cracking like machinegun fire. Local inha­bitants heard the meteorite strike
the ground. Imme­diately afterwards two stones, which fell at a distance of
about 400 metres from each other, were discovered burrowed in the sand at a
depth of approximately 25 cm.  The specimen received by the Smithsonian
Astrophysi­cal Observatory weighed 2.4 kg. Part of the specimen, weighing 1530

Automated cameras, radar, and infrasound sensors operated by UWO recorded the event, providing an orbit for the object and an accurate estimate of its fall location. Meteorites from the event fell in a 4 km by 8 km strewn field to the west and south of Grimsby, Ontario. One 46 g individual meteorite hit a parked vehicle and was recovered on the morning after the fall by A. Garchinsky. As of December 2009, 13 fragments had been found, totaling 215 g. Physical characteristics: (P. McCausland and R. Flemming, UWO): In situ micro-XRD of a fresh broken surface indicates the ubiquitous presence of low shock, about Fo90 olivine and enstatite, kamacite, and troilite as well as polycrystalline magnesioferrite spinel in the fusion crust. Polished thin sections show abundant chondrules and chondrule fragments ranging in size from 0.03 to 0.70 mm in apparent diameter. Matrix is variably recrystallized and chondrule rims are poorly defined, but feldspar is not well developed. Coarse olivines and pyroxenes show sharp optical extinction, implying a low shock state. Minor Fe-oxide has developed adjacent to some metal and troilite. Geochemistry: EPMA: olivine (Fa17.8 ± 0.4, n = 8) and low Ca pyroxene (Fs15.8 ± 1.0, n = 5). Classification: Ordinary chondrite (H5), S2, W0-1. Specimens: A 22 g sample and two polished thin sections are on deposit at UWO. Main mass held by Farmer."

Bencubbin-like meteorite 
A conical meteorite fell in a corn field near the village of Bogga Dingare after a bright fireball was witnessed moving west to east and an explosion was heard. The local people hammered the meteorite into many pieces, and most of the material was dispersed. The original mass is unknown, although secondhand reports indicate that it had a volume of ~20 000 cm3, and thus a mass of ~100 kg. Material that almost certainly came from this fall has been sold in the last few years elsewhere in Nigeria, with claims that the specimens were new finds. A preliminary description of the meteorite appears in Islam and Ostaficzuk (1988). Description (L. Karwowski, USil, based on the original mass): contains metal nodules, 1.5–8 mm in diameter, and silicate nodules 1–15 mm in diameter with fan-like aggregates of pyroxene; 60% of nodules are metal. Description and classification (A. Rubin and G. Kallemeyn, UCLA, based on a 282 g fragment purchased in 2000 near the village of Gidan Wire in Kaduna state): consists of large metal nodules containing variable amounts of troilite, and cryptocrystalline silicate spheroids; silicates include pyroxene (Fs1–2Wo1–3) and rare olivine (Fa3); siderophile abundance pattern in metal is similar to that of Bencubbin; shock stage, S2; weathering grade, W0. Oxygen isotopes (R. Clayton, UChi): light-colored silicates, δ17O = -2.19·, δ18O = +0.53·; dark-colored silicates, δ17O = -1.78·, δ18O = +0.98·. Specimens: 12.2 kg, mostly disintegrated, UMaid; 815 g, MZ; type specimen, 64 g, UCLA; remainder of 282 g mass, Twelker. "

Date of
fall or discovery: fall June 30, 1957, between 5:00 and 5:30 p.m. local
time.
Class and
type: stone; (probably, achondrite ? E.K.). 
The number
of separate specimens: was found one.
Total
weight: rough dimensions of the meteorite are 10 x 15 x 17.5 cm; weight
unknown.
The circumstances
of fall or discovery: the fireball passed northwestward and accompanied
with a noise like the reverberation of thunder has been observed. This
phenomenon has been marked in the radius about 160 km. At the end point of the trajectory
the fireball was broken up and disappea­red at the height about 10 or 12 km
above the earth’s surface.  The meteorite was found near the predicted point of
the fall, in the village Ibitira.  It lay in a hole in the ground about 25 cm
deep and 20 cm in diameter. The meteorite has a brilliant black crust, and a
light brown. It was brought to the Institute of Technological Researches (Belo Horizonte). Pre­liminary chemical analysis show the presence, in de­creasing order of abundance,
of silicon, magnesium, iron, aluminum, calcium, chromium, and titanium. Spectroscopic
examination reveals lines of sulphur and manganese, but there were no signs of
sodium, nickel and cobalt.

Upper Sava Valley, SloveniaFell: 9 Apr 2009, 3:00 CEST (UT+2)
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (L6)
History: On April 9, 2009, a bright fireball appeared over Carinthia and the Karavanke Mountains. The meteoroid entered the atmosphere at a steep angle and disintegrated into a large number of fragments after more than 4 s of  flight. In Jesenice and its vicinity, witnesses reported loud explosions following the disappearance of the fireball. Eyewitness reports were documented and evaluated by Thomas Grau (ERFM, Bernau). Two Czech automated fireball stations of the European Fireball Network (EN) recorded the bolide. Based on photographic and photoelectric records taken by the stations, Pavel Spurný and Jiří Borovička (Academy of Science, Czech Republic) determined the atmospheric trajectory and heliocentric orbit of the initial meteoroid. The bolide was also recorded by all-sky and meteor cameras in Slovenia. The supersonic boom was registered by infrasound stations and seismometers in Slovenia, Austria, Germany, and Italy. The first fragment (2.35 kg) of this fall was recovered by Jožef Pretnar and Bojana Krajnc on May 17, 2009. A second complete individual of 361 g was found on July 21, 2009 by Ralph Sporn and Martin Neuhofer  (46°25.079'N, 14°03.193'E) and a third one of 956 g by Danijel Repe on August 27, 2009 (46°25.473'N, 14°02.621'E). Total weight: approximately 3.667 kg.
Petrography and mineral compositions (A. Bischoff, IfP; Miha Jeršek, SMNH): The rock is fine-grained and shows brownish taints (weathering) on surfaces of the broken pieces. Shock veins were detected. In thin section Jesenice is highly recrystallized and a few relic chondrules are visible indicating it is a type 6 chondrite. This is also supported by the large grain size of plagioclase and homogeneous olivine and pyroxene. Mean olivine and low-Ca pyroxene are Fa25 and Fs21, respectively.
Classification: Jesenice is an L6, S3 ordinary chondrite.
Specimens: Main mass and type specimens located at SMNH.

Fall: 31 July 2006, 21:28 h. Indian Standard Time (IST) (UT+5 h) 
Ordinary chondrite (L5) 
History: A meteorite shower was witnessed on July 31, 2006, at 21:28 h. IST, in the regions of Jodiya, Jamnagar district, and Vandya, Kuchchh district, Gujarat. Many pieces fell in marshland and rain filled agricultural lands and could not be recovered. A search team from Geological Survey of India (GSI) has collected several fragments. 
Physical characteristics: The samples collected have fallen on rooftops of houses and/or courtyards. The largest sample collected is ~4 × 2 cm and is partly fusion crusted. An ~4 g sample, partly covered with fusion crust has been given to PRL, Ahmedabad, for analysis. 
Petrography: (Z. G. Ghevaria, GSI, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India and S. V. S. Murty, PRL) The general texture of the Jodiya meteorite is brecciated with porphyritic chondrules of olivine and low Ca pyroxene and low amount of metal. Chondrule sizes range from 0.92 to 1.46 with an average of 1.23 mm. The average olivine composition is Fa25.1, low Ca pyroxene is Fs21.2 and compositions are uniform within 1–2% suggesting that the metamorphic grade is 5–6, but trapped noble gas amounts fall in the range of 4–5. Thus, Jodiya is classified as L5. Δ17O is 1.16‰. 
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (L5) 
Type specimens: All collected fragments (~100 g) are in the possession of GSI, Calcutta. A thick section and a small, fusion crusted chip (~2 g) with FC are at PRL, Ahmedabad. "

Fall: 28 October 2004 and 16:30 (Indian Standard Time [UT+5 h]) 
Ordinary chondrite (L5/6) 
History: A stone fell in the farm of Kashiram Bhikabhai Diva in Nandgam village of Kaprada Taluka of Valsad district in South Gujarat, India at about 16:30 h. IST on 28th October, 2004. The meteorite was promptly brought to Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad by Manoj Pai, an amateur astronomer of Ahmedabad. 
Physical characteristics: The single recovered stone weighed about 1.6 kg. The stone is mostly crusted and has an approximately conical shape, the convex face containing the apex having been smoothened due to ablation whereas the concave base appears rough. 
Petrography: (N. Bhandari, S. V. S. Murty, R. R. Mahajan, P. N. Shukla, A. D. Shukla, PRL; M. S. Sisodia, JNVU; G. Parthasarathy, PNGRI; an V. K. Rai; Department of Chemistry, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA [UCSD]) The major minerals in the meteorite are olivine, clino- and orthopyroxene, and metal and sulfide. Some glass is also present. The meteorite shows a melt crystallization texture and veins. A variety of chondrule types is present, the commonest being granular olivine and olivine-pyroxene and radiating fine-grained pyroxene. The chondrule margins are diffuse, tending to merge with the granular groundmass, which consists of olivine and pyroxene with minor sub equal amounts of nickel-iron and troilite. 
Mineral compositions and geochemistry: The olivine is Fa23.7 and pyroxene is Wo39.92En43.3Fs16.79. The chemical composition is Fe = 21.5%, Mg = 15.3%, Al = 1.2%, Ni = 1.27%, Ca = 1.33% by weight as determined by X-ray fluorescence. 
Classification: The meteorite is an ordinary chondrite, (L 5/6).

A single stone weighing
16.82 kg accompanied by a thundering sound fell at Kasauli village (29° 35' N:
77° 35' E), Muuzaffarnagar district, Uttar Pradesh, India creating an oval
shaped crater. The fall was witnessed by villagers of Kasauli. The meteorite
was retrieved by the Geological Survey of India (GSI). The single mass
of Kasauli meteorite is almost an oriented one and has a plano-convex
turtle-back shape with a truncated ellipsoidal outline. The crust is grayish in
color, netted in nature. A few visible chondrules are distinct on the surface.
Minute shiny metallic knobs are observed on the surface of the meteorite.

Iron meteorite (IIE-Anom.) 
History: Two shepherds witnessed the fall of a single piece (6.8 kg) in bright day light, and reported to the local police. It is an iron mass with regmaglyphs on the surface. A cut piece of ~20 g has been given to PRL, Ahmedabad for analysis. 
Physical and chemical characteristics (Z. G. Ghevaria, GSI, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India, and S. V. S. Murty, PRL, Ahmedabad, India): Polished and etched surface shows Widmanstätten pattern with fine kamacite bandwidths. Optical microscopic observation revealed inclusions ranging in size from few tens of microns to few hundred micrometers across on the polished surface. Qualitative EPMA studies show that some of the inclusions are C rich and some are rich in Si, Cr and P, in addition to Fe, Ni. Preliminary data on siderophiles (Ni 9.5%, Co 0.39%, Ir 1.6 ppm, Ga 6.8 ppm and Ge 5.8 ppm) by ICP-MS and the presence of non-metallic inclusions suggest that Kavarpura can be classified as IIE-Anom. A very interesting feature of this meteorite is the presence of solar noble gases. 
Classification: Iron meteorite (IIE-Anom.)

Classification: Ordinary chondrite (L4)
History: Sonic booms were heard between 11 am and noon local time south of Kemer Town, Fethiye County, Mugla. A young woman, Mrs Rabia Saadet, was hanging out her washing when she was startled by a loud booming sound. A stone fell about 50 m away in her wheat field by her house. Panicked, she hid in her home. Later she went back to the field and discovered a black stone buried about 25 cm. Her father called the village chief, ""muhtar"", who called the local police. Another rock was found 500 m away and both were taken to Fethiye Governor’s Office. Mesut Kasikci, a meteorite hunter living in France called the muhtar and informed Prof. Mehmet Emin Özel, an astrophysicist at CanaU, Physics Department, of the fall. Prof. Özel and Tamer Akin, his assistant, went to Fethiye and acquired the stones from the Governor. A third piece was found ten days later.
Physical characteristics: Three fusion crusted stones were found: Stone 1, 4 × 11 × 7.5 cm, 2.56 kg; Stone 2, 1.7 kg, 36°32'39.9""N, 29°24'49.9""E; and Stone 3, 1.5 kg - 36°32'35.4""N 29°24'20""E).
Petrography: Matrix poor, chondrule rich. Chondrules of variable sizes and textures, some slightly deformed. Occurrence of rare relict olivines, chromites, two phosphates: chlorapatite and whitlockite up to 300 μm. An idiomorphic Zr oxide was observed in an ilmenite crystal from a chondrule. Amoeboid objects containing diopside, chromite and feldspar. Polycrystalline sulfides, healed faults and maskelynite.
Geochemistry: EMPA of crystals indicate a more homogeneous composition for the olivine (Fa23-25 average 24, sd=1) than for the pyroxene (average Fs19, sd=4).
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (L4)
Specimens: A sample of 157.2 g from the first stone, a PTS and a thick PS are on deposit at the MNHNP. Mr Kasikçi holds the main mass. The second (1.7 kg) and the third (1.5 kg) stones are kept by Prof. Özel now at CagU.

Chondrite (H4-5)
A brilliant fireball with intense
greenish hue appeared in the  northern sky and progressed towards southern
horizon and was  observed by a large number of people in the southern part of
the  state of West Bengal and coastal Orissa. The event led to a  multiple fall
along the coastal Orissa. Three pieces of meteorite  were retrieved by the
Geological Survey of India (GSI) from  Subarnapur village (20° 32' 22'' N: 86°
42' E), East Suniti  village (20° 27' 30'' N: 86° 43' 15'' E) and West Suniti
village  (20° 27' 45'' N: 86° 42' 10'' E) in the Kendrapada district of 
Orissa; the weights of the recovered fragments are 490.2 g, 719 g  and 5460 g,
respectively. The meteorite samples are dark on unbroken  surface and light
colored on broken surface where metals are  readily visible. Rusting is
conspicuous on the broken surface and may be attributed to the wet
environment of fall. The main mass of  the meteorite has incomplete tabular
polyhedral shape. Thin section  study (B. K. Chattopadhyay and A.P.Thapliyal, GSI)
shows Kendrapada  meteorite is essentially composed of olivine, pyroxene,
abundant  Fe-Ni metal, troilite and rare feldspar. Chondrules of varying  shape
and sizes and texture are present but are few in number and  range in size from
0.15 mm to 0.5 mm. Fa content in olivine varies  between 18.2 and 19.6 (n = 22)
with an average Fa content of 18.8.   Fs content in  Opx varies from 14.4 to
17.4 (n = 17) with an average of 16.4.   The matrix is fine-grained and
moderately recrystallized. Shock stage is S2. Specimens: type specimen 6 kg,
Geological Survey of India, Calcutta ; some fragments are with Government of
Orissa, Bhubaneswar, India.

noise. On the next day he found the stone in the attic. Prof. C. Hoffmeister
points out that there were no observations whatever of the fireball or acoustic
pheno­mena, which is very strange. He further points out that in the case of
the Ramsdorf meteorite, July 26, 1958 (see the Meteoritical Bulletin,. No. 13,

History: On February 28, 2010, at 22:24:46 UT a bright fireball appeared over central-eastern Slovakia. The cloudy and rainy weather prevented images been taken by the European Fireball Network or the Slovak Video Network. However, the fireball flash was recorded at six Czech and one Austrian fireball stations (P. Spurny, CzAS). The bolide reached at least -18 maximum brightness. Sonic booms were recorded at seven seismic stations in Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland (P. Kalenda, CzASO). The fall area was computed on the basis of two records of the surveillance cameras operating in Hungary (A. Igaz, HAA) by J. Borovicka (CzAS). The first meteorite (27.2 g) was found March 20 by J. Toth (CUB) to the northwest of the city of Košice (eastern Slovakia). Pieces were found by teams led by the Faculty of the Mathematics, Physics and Informatics, CUB and SAS. The largest stone weighs 2.2 kg.

Virginia, United StatesFell: 18 Jan 2010, 5:45 PM EST (UT-5)
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (L6)
History: People in the greater Washington DC area (with reports from as far away as West Virginia) describe seeing a large, single, fireball near dusk on Monday, January 18th, 2010 (~5:45 PM).  Some describe hearing a large detonation.  At 5:45, one stone fell through the roof and ceiling of the Williamsburg Square Family Practice in Lorton, Virginia.  The meteorite was found embedded in the concrete floor (under the carpet), apparently having broken into three large pieces and a number of smaller pieces upon impact.  The doctors were present at the time the meteorite fell, and describe hearing a sound akin to bookshelves crashing to the ground.  The meteorite was brought to the Smithsonian Institution for identification.
Physical characteristics: The meteorite is approximately 8 x 5 x 5 cm, roughly rectangular, with dark, matte fusion crust. The interior is fresh, with no evidence of oxidation of the metal grains, which are small and evenly distributed throughout the rock.  A few small poorly defined chondrules are visible with the naked eye.  The total mass recovered is 329.7 g.
Petrography: Shock stage: S1 (olivines have irregular fractures).  Weathering grade: W0. Shock veins absent.  Chondrules are rare.  When present, chondrule outlines are diffuse and show some degree of recrystallization, with many crystals exhibiting 120° triple junctions.   Metal and sulfide occur mostly as separate, blocky grains.
Geochemistry: (C. Corrigan, SI) Olivine, Fa24.7±0.3 (n=23), pyroxene Fs20.9±0.3, Wo1.6±0.2 (n=16), feldspar An10.3±0.3, Or6.4±2.8 (n=14)

Mahadevpur, Near Namsai Town, Arunachal Pradesh, India 
Fall: 21 February 2007, 9:10 Indian Standard Time (IST) 
Ordinary chondrite (H4/5) 
History: The fall was witnessed by many people. The meteoroid broke up mid air and fell as several pieces. At least 4 large fragments were collected; the largest is ~60 kg and is in private hands. A 3.4 kg piece fell through the roof of a house and into the living room, in Mahadevpur, Arunachal Pradesh, and was collected by Guwahati University, Assam. 
Physical and chemical characteristics: (A. C. Mazumdar, Guwahati University, Assam, India and S. V. S. Murty, PRL, Ahmedabad) The meteorite is a heterogeneous aggregate of chondrules of varying types (dominantly porphyritic) and the matrix made up of mostly chondrules fragments. Chondrule sizes range from 250 to 1300 μm. The various mineral phases are olivine (Fa19), orthopyroxene (En82 Fs17 Wo1), clinopyroxene (En57 Fs8 Wo35), albitic plagioclase (Ab87 Or3 An10), kamacite, taenite, apatite and rare chromite. Olivine grains both in chondrules and matrix are homogeneous. Chemical composition and Δ17O (0.857‰) match with H chondrites. Low amounts of trapped noble gases suggest that Mahadevpur belongs to metamorphic grade 4/5. Shock stage is S1. 
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (H4/5) 
Type specimen: The main mass (~3.2 kg) and thin sections are with Guwahati University (GauU); A small mass is with PRL, on loan from GauU. Total known weight is 70.5 kg "

A meteorite broke into pieces and fell across the
Niger-Nigeria border. One stone fell at the border town, Rigar Jobi in Maigatari
Local Government Council, Nigeria. Mr. Malam Musa was standing in front of his
hut when he heard a strange sound like the sound of a plane coming towards him.
When he looked at the sky, he saw a black object falling towards him. The
object fell about 15 meters away from him. His son, standing under a tree about
30 meters away, also saw the falling object and started running towards his
father, but before he could reach him, the object had made it to Earth with a
loud crash. Then there was another loud fall about 2-2.5km away, in Danduma, a
small village west-northwest of the town Adara on the Niger Republic side,
where two pieces of the meteorite, including the main mass, were recovered.
Neighbours running to the site found a black stone which had shattered (or
perhaps they broke it) into pieces. They brought some of
the pieces to the local chief who presented them to the emir of Maigatari Local
Government Council, Jigawa State, Nigeria. The total mass recovered was about 4.6 kg. Mineralogy and classification F.

Carbonaceous chondrite (CM2)
History: A bright fireball was seen over the Baltic Sea at 20:09 (CET), January 17, 2009. The fireball was caught on a surveillance video camera in southern Sweden and on an all sky camera in the Netherlands. Three bright explosions are seen on the video and a glowing plasma trail that persisted about 3 s. Explosions were heard up to five minutes after the fireball in southern Zealand, on the eastern part of the island Lolland, and at the German Baltic Sea. 550 eyewitness reports were received by the Danish fireball network. The supersonic boom was registered by two infrasound stations and a few seismometers in Germany and Denmark. The bolide’s light curve was recorded by a few radiometers of the European Fireball Network. On March 4, the Thomas Grau (ERFM) found the first and so far only meteorite from the fall. The meteorite had penetrated a few cm into a grass surface. 
Physical characteristics: One fragment was recovered. The meteorite appeared intact when found, but fell into many pieces when it was touched, probably due to the action of freezing and thawing during the six weeks that passed before it was found. The total mass was 25.8 g. 
Petrography (A. Bischoff, IfP; H. Haack, NHMD): Various coarse-grained components are embedded within an opaque fine-grained matrix. These components include chondrules, fine-grained olivine aggregates, large isolated lithic and mineral fragments (often olivine), rare CAIs, and porous aggregates. The components are typically rimmed by fine-grained dust mantles. The abundance of chondrules is low. Chondrule diameters are generally less than 0.4 mm with a few up to 0.9 mm. Some chondrules are partially altered to tochilinite and cronstedtite. Metals occur (as a minor constituent) in chondrules and matrix. The porous aggregates are irregular in shape and measure a couple of hundred microns across. They contain zoned grains of olivine and pyroxene, tochilinite, cronstedtite, pyrrhotite and pentlandite. The matrix includes abundant dust rimmed fragments of tochilinite with a layered structure. 
Mineral compositions and geochemistry: Most olivines in the coarse-grained components are Fo-rich, but some Fe-rich olivines have been found (Fa up to 85 mol%). Oxygen isotopes: (I. Franchi and R. Greenwood, OU), (mean of two replicates: δ17O = −1.27‰; δ18O = 4.96‰; Δ17O = −3.85‰) 
Classification: Carbonaceous chondrite (CM2), shock stage S0. 
Type specimens: As required by Danish law T. Grau turned in the meteorite to NHMD. A total of 24 g and three thin sections are now on deposit at the NHMD. One thin section is on deposit at UM. "

Western Australia, AustraliaFell: 13 April 2010 at 10h36m10s UTC
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (H5)
History: A bright fireball was recorded over southwestern Australia by observatories of the Desert Fireball Network. A fall position was pin-pointed by triangulation (Pavel Spurny, CzAS), and a search was mounted (Martin Towner, ICL). A stone was recovered 3rd November 2010 within 150 m of the predicted fall site.
Physical characteristics: (Gretchen Benedix, NHM; Philip Bland, Kathryn Dyl, Martin Towner, ICL). An ~3 cm, 50% fusion crusted, 24.54 g stone was recovered.  Individual pyroxene, olivine, and feldspar crystals are visible on the broken surface, with no evidence of alteration of silicates. Some rust patches visible around metal grains on original broken surfaces. Although the meteorite appears to have high porosity (based on observations of sawn surfaces), metal in the interior shows no sign of alteration. Fusion crust is black and fresh.
Petrography: (Gretchen Benedix, NHM). The meteorite has a typical petrologic type 5 texture, with discernible, but not distinct chondrules. Chondrule types include BO and RP.  Minerals are heterogeneously distributed. Modal mineralogy (in vol%) is: olivine 33; orthopyroxene 38; clinopyroxene 5; plagioclase 8; metal 11; sulfide 5; minor components around 1.
Geochemistry: (Gretchen Benedix, NHM; Richard Greenwood, Ian Franchi, Jenny Gibson, OU). Mineral compositions as determined by EMP: olivine, Fa19.2±0.6; low-Ca pyroxene, Fs16.±0.4Wo1.4±0.3; chromite (Fe/Fe+Mg = 0.84; Cr/Cr+Al  = 0.86). Oxygen isotopes: δ17O = 3.04‰; δ18O = 4.42‰; Δ17O = 0.74‰. 
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (H5), S1, minimal weathering.
Specimens: The stone and one thin section are on deposit at WAM.

The fall occurred in a heavily populated area in and around
the city Mbale. A loud explosion was heard which persisted for some time as a
rumbling noise. For about two minutes a greyish-white smoke trail was seen. A
meteorite shower fell over an area of about 3 x 7 km. The stones hit several
buildings, but nobody was hurt. An expedition was organized by the Dutch Meteor
Society, the Leiden Observatory, and Makerere University between August 29 and
September 5; it located 48 impact positions of masses between 27.4 kg and 0.1

Iowa County, Wisconsin, United StatesFell: April 14, 2010, 10:07 pm CDT (UT-5)
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (L5)
History: A bright fireball was seen by numerous observers in parts of Wisconsin, Iowa, and Illinois the night of April 14, 2010. A camera on the roof of the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Building at the University of Wisconsin-Madison captured two images of the fireball at around 10:07 PM. The track was recorded by Doppler radar.  Residents in Mifflin Township, Wisconsin, heard large explosions at the same time. The first stone recovered (7.4 g) hit the metal roof of a shed and was found the following day; it was identified as a meteorite at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Numerous stones fell as a shower mainly in the area of Mifflin Township within a total distance of 20 km. More than 70 stones and fragments were recovered in the area within a few weeks after the fall.
Physical characteristics: Total mass recovered is more than 3.5 kg. The largest stone, 332 g, is owned by the finder and private collectors. Most pieces are fully enclosed in fusion crust.
Petrography, description, and classification (N. Kita, J. W. Valley, D. Nakashima, T. Ushikubo, M. J. Spicuzza, UWisc; G. MacPherson, L. Welzenbach, SI; A. M. Davis, UChi; P. R. Heck, FMNH). Most stones are partly to fully fusion crusted. Some broken surfaces show brecciated texture, with dark and light clasts. Black-colored shock veins up to a few mm long were observed. Chondrules are not obvious in hand specimen, but are visible in thin section.
Geochemistry: Mineral compositions and geochemistry: Olivine (Fo75.1±0.2; n=15), low-Ca pyroxene (En78.9±0.2Wo1.5; n=16). Oxygen isotope analysis (Mike Spicuzza by laser fluorination/gas-source MS): δ18O=4.84‰, δ17O=3.65‰, Δ17O=1.13‰.
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (L5), shock stage S1.
Specimens: Type specimen 21.09 g, SI. Other stones at: UWisc: 142 g; FMNH: 48 g, 17.8 g, 13.1 g, 6.94 g.

Circumstances
of fall: After the appearance of a fireball and detonations, a
stone fell into a salt-field near the sea shore. The owner of the field,
Rokubei Murase, saw the fall and recovered the meteorite soon afterwards. The
stone was later presented to a Shinto shrine, Yobitsugi jinja, where it
remained as a holy treasure. Permission to examine the stone was given to staff
of the National Science Museum, Tokyo, in August 1976, when its meteoritic
nature was confirmed. The stone remains in the Yobitsugi shrine.

Total weight: 149 kg
Circumstances of find: During a night in the summer of 1923, M. de Bataille, chatting with some friends in the enclosure of his property of Grouaulet, saw at a slight altitude a very bright, greenish object, accompanied by a whistling sound and traveling in a south-north direction. This object left in the sky, up to the instant of the presumed fall, a strong light perceptable for some time. One of his companions, running astonished, rushed forward in the direction of the impact but found nothing. The incident was not forgotten by the witnesses. After a number of years, the plowshare of the plow of M. Krivobokow, working the farm of Gravette, got hung up on a hard,-embedded mass. In 1966, he decided to extricate it. The appearance of the ""rock"", abnormal in the clay-like soil of the region, brought to mind the story of his neighbor. In June 1971, during a prospecting mission of the Commission on Atomic Energy, a geologist instituted the previous deduction and confirmed that the object was a meteorite. It was recovered with a thin crust of iron hydroxides of a thickness of 1 to 2 mm, and exhibited the very characteristic cup-like structures and shatter cones.

2006, a bright fireball traveling SSE-NNW was witnessed by many people and a loud
explosion and a rumbling sound was heard in the air above Moss and Rygge in
south Norway, on the east side of the Oslofjord. Shortly after, a small
meteorite was heard to land on an aluminum sheet and was recovered. Extensive
searches in the area have resulted in the recovery of a total of 5 stones
(Table 6).  Note that light rainfall occurred in the area on July 29, 30, and

Petrography: (J. Grossman, USGS; G.
MacPherson, SI; L. Chizmadia, UHaw; A. Rubin, UCLA): Contains
abundant small chondrules (most < 200 μm), small (<1 mm) amoeboid
olivine aggregates (AOAs) and refractory inclusions, and isolated grains of
olivine, troilite, and kamacite set in a gray matrix.  Chondrule types are dominated
by type-I PO, with other varieties of type I and II chondrules plus RP, C, and
BO all present.  All type I chondrules show diffusional entry of FeO around
edges and along cracks of forsterite grains. Olivine histogram is flat,
resembling that of Ornans (range Fa0.3–42, average Fa19.9,
σ=65%, n=60); Cr2O3 content of fayalitic olivine is
low (0.09±0.09 wt%).  Image analysis gives 2.2 vol% metal and 2.4 vol% FeS.  Refractory inclusions contain spinel, calcic pyroxene, and abundant nepheline that
replaces melilite and other primary phases; some perovskite has been
transformed to ilmenite. Some AOAs contain relict cores of forsterite, but most
of the olivine has been converted to more fayalitic compositions; degree of
oxidation of AOAs is similar to type 3.6 CO chondrites such as ALH 77003.
Matrix is mildly recrystallized and sulfur-poor; matrix olivine has similar
composition to olivine in fine-grained chondrules and inclusions.
Geochemistry: Magnetic susceptibility (R.
Bartoschewitz), log χ (10-9 m3·kg-1) =

Three nearly simultaneous roaring thunderous sounds were heard in the
north-east direction. Suddenly with a hissing sound a fragment fell in cultivated
land, making a pit 13.5 cm deep and 9 cm in surface diameter. It was recovered
within one minute of its fall and was said to be hot enough to burn the
fingers. The specimen weighing 1.092 kg is irregular and covered by an
extremely thin fusion crust preserved especially on the irregular face with
regmaglypts. The smooth portion of the meteorite was the front when it fell on
the ground. In the Man Bishunpur:  Three thunderous sounds were heard in the
N30ºE and the meteorite was seen to fall down with a hissing sound. The
specimen weighing 153 gr. is nearly, flat with rounded edges. Fusion crust on
one face, rest of the surface is covered with fused material. This specimen
fell 3 km southwest of the larger one and fell further along the trajectory of
the meteorite. Both the specimens were turned over to the collections of the
Geological Survey of India (Calcutta, India). The smaller specimen was obtained
to the temporary loan by Dr. R. Dietz (Washington, USA). It was transmitted to

The fall circumstances were well documented by the European Fireball Network (EFN). Reduction of the EFN photographs allowed calculation of the orbit and impact area (Spurny et al. 2002) which ultimately led to the recovery of a single stone of 1.75 kg on July 14, 2002. Gamma spectrometry (G. Heusser and H. Neder, MPI-K) of the stone indicates a small pre-atmospheric radius of less than 20 cm mainly from the low 60Co activity of 1.2 ± 0.5 dpm/kg. Short-lived radionuclides strongly indicate that the recovered meteorite was indeed the object that fell on the above date. Classification and mineralogy (A. Bischoff, Mün and J. Zipfel, MPI): the meteorite has a metamorphic texture with a small number of chondrule relics. Major phases are enstatite (FeO <0.1 wt%), plagioclase (Ab82), and metal (~1.5 wt% Si). Large crystals of sinoite (up to 200 µm) and graphite (up to 700 × 200 µm) are present. Additional phases so far observed are schreibersite ((Fe,Ni)3P), troilite (FeS), oldhamite (CaS), daubreelite (FeCr2S4), alabandite, ((Mn,Fe)S), and an SiO2­ phase (containing 1–2 wt% Al2O3). Bulk chemistry: abundances of moderately volatile lithophile elements are typical for EL chondrites, low Mn/Mg = 0.010 and Na/Mg = 0.045, and low Zn concentration (Zn <20 ppm); high concentrations of siderophile elements, e.g., Ni = 1.94% and Ir = 0.76 ppm, reflect higher than usual metal contents for EL chondrites. Based on texture, mineralogy and chemistry the meteorite is classified as an EL6 chondrite. Optical features indicate that the rock is very weakly shocked (S2). The residence time of about three months on the ground resulted in the first signs of weathering (W0/1). The exposure age is ~48 Ma; trapped subsolar noble gases are present (L. Franke and L. Schultz, MPI). Specimens: type specimen, 20 g, MPI; thin sections: Mün; main mass, unknown. "

On
the afternoon of September 23rd 2003, a meteorite crashed through the two-story
home of Ray and Judy Fausset, who were not at home at the time. Neighbors said
that they heard a ""terrific noise.""  Two observations of a fireball
were recorded. The main mass of the meteorite was found in the crawl space
under the house. Powdery meteorite debris and fragments were found along the
penetration path throughout the house. A total mass of 19.256 kg was recovered
from the Fausset house, the three largest fragments weighing 2966 g, 1292 g and
1001 g. Some additional material (~100 g) was also recovered in the surrounding
neighborhood.  Description and classification (S. Nelson, Tulane University; R. Jones and A. Brearley, UNM; T. Bunch and J. Wittke, NAU): The
meteorite is light grey with a black fusion crust, and very friable. Abundant
metal and troilite are visible on broken surfaces, as well as some thin
(mm-thick) impact melt veins. Classification and mineralogy: The meteorite is
very fragmented on a sub-mm scale. Mean compositions of olivine, Fa17.6;
orthopyroxene, Fs15.4Wo1.4; clinopyroxene, Fs10.4Wo24.8;
plagioclase, An12.8Or5.6; metal, Ni = 6.7 wt %, Co = 0.38
%. Minor chromite and phosphate are present. The meteorite broke a pipe and
many fragments sat in water for several days. Because of this and the humid
climate in New Orleans, light oxidation of interior metal within small
fragments (<100 g) was evident within a week of the fall. Shock level, S1.
Specimens: type specimens 82 g UNM and 63 g NAU; main mass with

Fall: 8 November 2004
Achondrite (eucrite, monomict)
History: On Monday, November 8, 2004, around 6:15
P.M., Ms. Donna Shuford was startled by the noise of something hitting the side
of her house. She discovered that something had hit the top of her car and
ricocheted onto the side of her house. A single ~180 g stone that had
fragmented on impact was found.
Petrography and Geochemistry: (D. Mittlefehldt and M.
Zolensky, NASA JSC) Major phases are low-Ca pyroxene (Wo3En35Fs62;
Fe/Mn ~30) with lamellae of high-Ca pyroxene (Wo45En29Fs26),
and calcic plagioclase (An71– 83Ab16–28Or~1).
Minor phases include titanian chromite (TiO2 = 16–20, Al2O3
= 2–3, MgO = 0.4, MnO = 0.8; [all wt%]), ilmenite (MgO = 0.5, MnO = 0.9 [both
wt%]), with silica, iron sulfide, and Fe,Ni metal. The rock is largely
unbrecciated, but has shock veins with granular texture and containing some
glass. Remnant ophitic/subophitic igneous texture is preserved with plagioclase
laths ~1 mm by ~30 µm, and ~2 mm blocky pyroxene grains. In much of the rock,
pyroxene has been recrystallized to ~20–50 µm equant grains while plagioclase
retains its original shape.
Classification: Achondrite (eucrite, monomict).
Specimens: A 20 g type specimen is on deposit at SI.
The finder holds the main mass.

Gnagna, Burkina FasoFell: November 2003
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (L5)
History: In November of 2003, Michael Farmer traveled to Burkina Faso to purchase meteorites. During his visit he heard of a recent fall near the town of Bilanga. Mr. Farmer bought ~1.6 kg of the new fall in Bilanga, then traveled to the fall site ~40 km NNW to the villages of Batiawo and Lampiaiyre  (several km SE of Oudangou). Here he purchased the remaining 2.84 kg of stones. According to the villagers of Batiawo and Lampyaire, the stones fell within the villages and surrounding bushland, during the afternoon in early November 2003, though the exact date could not be agreed upon. Several of the stones from Batiawo had been broken into pieces by villagers. The largest stone (broken into three pieces) is 2031 g.
Physical characteristics: All stones are well-rounded showing broad, poorly developed regmaglypts, and covered by a velvety fusion crust up to 0.5 mm thick. The few reddish patches on the exterior are from the local soil. Interior is primarily white, with heterogeneous distribution of gray clasts. Clasts to 5 cm, rounded, some with scalloped margins. A few large metal-troilite nodules, to 1.5 cm. Sparse shock veining. None of the stones show signs of rusting.
Petrography: (L. Garvie, ASU) Matrix largely recrystallized with disseminated plagioclase grains <50 μm, rarely to 200 μm. Scattering of distinct chondrules, some to 1 mm, including RP, PO, and BO. Localized melting forming silicate-metal-sulfide pods. Two 1 cm2 sections show ~10 Cu grains each. Cu grains (<50 μm across) occur at metal/sulfide boundaries, and associated as a complex taenite-troilite-copper assemblage. Troilite grains show a range of pressure effects from undistorted and monocrystalline, to those with undulose extinction and a few exhibiting spindle-like twin lamellae. Chromite grains extensively fractured. Range of achondritic clast types, from dark and fine-grained to light colored with a sugary texture. Two of the light-colored clasts contain white veins. Clasts largely metal-troilite free, medium-grained, some vuggy with euhedral crystals.
Geochemistry: Olivine Fa24.6±0.3, range 24.1 to 25.3, FeO/MnO=48.3±3.3, n=13. Two grains P-rich, with P2O5 to 0.11 wt%. Low Ca pyroxene Fs20.2±0.2, range 20.2 to 20.6, Wo1.4±0.1, range 1.2 to 1.6, n=7.
Specimens: 197 g at ASU.

On 16 October 2003, Moroccan soldiers stationed in
Western Sahara saw  a meteorite falling on Gour Lafkah Mountains, south of
Zbayra, about 21 km from Oum Dreyga. The meteorite fell near a 670 km long wall
built in 1985, protected by antipersonnel mines, and guarded by soldiers. About
17 kg were recovered. Stones from this fall were later brought to Moroccan
dealers. Most of them have been collected after a rainfall and are thus
slightly oxidized. However, some fragments have been picked up soon after the fall;
these are very fresh. Fragments have been sold under the names Amgala and Gor
Lefcah. Classification and mineralogy (M. Bourot-Denise, MNHNP): very

The small stone was presumably collected by people of the Sendar village who were coming to Patora to participate in the festival and handed over the meteorite to Mr. Bhikarilal. On October 21, 1969, Mr. Bhikarilal returned to Rajim (police headquarters) via Fingeshwar village, reported the event and deposited both pieces of the meteorite.

Pleşcoi Village, Berca Commune, Buzău Co, RomaniaFell: 12 June 2008, 21:45 h local time EEST (UT+3) 
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (L5/6)
History: On 12 June, 2008, a bolide was observed by eyewitnesses from 6 counties in south Romania (along about 325 km distance); locally it was accompanied by sonic booms. The fireball was white green, very brilliant and it crossed the skies along a W-E trajectory, at an angular height of 35-40º above the horizon (eyewitnesses reports on ""Urbi et Orbi"", author Valentin Ghincolov).
Physical characteristics: One mass (6.913 kg) of basic conical shape (20 × 19 × 11 cm) with a flat side was discovered by Mihail Popescu in his garden. The stone remained where it had landed for approximately 3 weeks. The specimen showed a dull, black, fusion crust (1 mm thick) with a thin network of cracks; only a a very small (about 2 × 1.5 cm) area of the light-gray breccia with metallic grains (<1 mm) was revealed. The flat surface exhibits some lighter-colored strips and parallel thread lines marked by molten drops.
Petrography: (Dana Pop, BBU; Gretchen Benedix, NHM): Chondrule outlines are obscure under the optical microscope, but more discernable in BSE images. Recognizable chondrule types include barred olivine and radiating pyroxene. The fusion crust is relatively thick. The matrix is fully recrystallized; brecciation is not obvious. Metal and troilite grains are relatively fresh, sometimes with thin weathering rims.  Olivine exhibits undulatory extinction.
Geochemistry: Olivine (Fa25.5±0.3; n = 56), low-Ca pyroxene (Fs21.4±0.1; Wo1.3±0.2; n = 34). Chromite (Cr/Cr + Al = 0.85; Fe/Fe + Mg = 0.86).
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (L5/6); S2, W1
Specimens: A 20 g sample, two thin sections and two thick sections are on deposit at BBU. One 49.95 g piece and one thin section are deposited at NHM. The main mass is with the finder of the stone (M. Popescu).

Ordinary chondrite
(H6) 
After detonations were heard and smoky
trails seen in the sky, a shower of meteorites landed near Portales, New
Mexico. 53 objects have been recovered, with a total mass of 71.4 kg. The
largest pieces weighed 16.5 kg (witnessed to fall by Nelda Wallace and Fred
Stafford), 17.0 kg (found by Elton Brown), and at least nine others over 1 kg.
A 530 g fragment went through the roof of Gayle Newberry's barn and embedded
itself in a wall, indicating a trajectory west to east. The elliptical strewn
field is approximately 7.7 ´ 2 km,
trending N60–65ºE, although recent reports may extend this somewhat. Mineralogy
(D. A. Kring, J. D. Gleason, and D. H. Hill, UAz ): olivine, Fa19.3
±0.4; pyroxene, Fs17.2
±0.3 Wo1.36±0.27; kamacite contains 0.55 ± 0.03 wt% Co; compositions indicate
H-chondrite affinity; olivine indicates shock stage S1, plagioclase indicates
S2–S3, and abundant opaque shock veins suggest S3 or higher (discrepancies may
be due to annealing).  Macroscopic description (D. A. Kring, UAz ): Some
individuals are crosscut by an unusually high number of metal-rich shock veins,
and some specimens are composed dominantly of metal. These metal-rich samples
appear to be large single veins, or pockets of metal produced by intersecting
veins. Angular chondritic clasts may have moved a few millimeters along
metal-rich veins.  Etching of centimeter-sized metal areas reveals a fine
Widmanstätten pattern, bandwidth = 0.02 to 0.81 mm (average 0.32 mm). The
composition of kamacite in metal-rich regions is the same as metal in
chondritic areas (0.56 ± 0.05 wt% Co).
The source of the metal in the shock veins appears to be the H-chondrite host,
which is depleted in its normal complement of metal (4.4% rather than 15–19%).
Specimens: type specimen, 49 g, and thin section, UAz; 16.5 kg mass
purchased by consortium including FMNH, SI, UCLA, and UNM.
17.0 kg mass with finder; much of remaining material is being sold by
commercial meteorite dealers.

The circumstances
of fall or discovery: The meteorite fell from a clear sky and neither light
nor percussion phenomena were observed. The fall was accompanied by a noise
similar to that of propeller; it started and stopped suddenly. Shortly afterwards
children and young people discovered steam rising from a tube-shaped depres­sion
in the ground. The following morning the depression was excavated and at a
depth of 40 cm. the meteorite was discovered. The depression had an eastward
direction and an incline angle of about 30° to the vertical. The children broke
the meteorite into five parts which match each other, thus making it possible
to reestablish the original shape of the meteorite; it is polyhedral with
rounded ribs and regmaglipts visible in places.

left a white cloud behind with a diameter of approximately 2° and a train. The
train disappeared about 10 minutes after the appearance of bolide while the
cloud was visible for about 30 minutes. During this time it moved approximately
15° to the east. The cloud was located at an altitude of about 60°. The flight

Representatives with the Sonora Police Department and both the Tuolumne and Calaveras County Sheriff’s Departments fielded numerous calls early on the morning of the 11th in regards to a loud boom, and structures shaking. Campers around Markleeville, Soulsbyville, and Beardsley Lake reported sonic booms and ground shaking. A video from the fireball from Yuba City placed the breakup at 5 ' +7 "" past midnight. A single stone was picked up by a hiker, Ben Deutsch near Red Canyon Lake, Tuolumne County, California, shortly after the fireball event. Physical characteristics: One black fusion-crusted stone was recovered. The interior of the stone is exceptionally fresh with no signs of oxidation of the metal. Matrix is light gray with an abundance of metal and sulfide and a smattering of well-defined, gray, <1 mm chondrules. Only one stone of 18.41 g was recovered. Petrography: (Laurence Garvie, ASU) The stone has an overall recrystallized texture, with a few well-defined chondrules. Feldspar is not well developed. One metal-rich vein traverses the stone. Areal percentages determined from one thin section show 5.5% metal, 2.0% troilite, and 0.01% chromite. Contains a rare unidentified Fe-Cr sulfide. Geochemistry: (Laurence Garvie, ASU) Olivine - Fa19.40 (range 19.23 to 19.58, n=9); Pyroxene - Fs16.74 (range 16.54 to 16.89) and Wo1.11 (range 0.76 to 1.30). Classification: Ordinary chondrite (H5), shock stage S1 Specimens: ASU holds 4.24 g distributed between a complete slice, two thin sections and an end piece in a potted butt."

unsuccessful, but two guides and trappers living ten km. south of the fall area
in the course of their spring trapping operations for beaver, observed two
impact areas on the ice of a small lake, and ano­ther two in the snow of the
neighbouring forest. These small fragments lay directly along the trace of
trajectory plotted by Drs. J. Galt and E. Argyle of the Dominion Radio Astro
Physical Laboratory at Pen­ticton, British Columbia, and L. Bayrock of the
Research Council of Alberta, Edmonton.  Two of the samples of disaggregated

snow. Identification was made at the, Uni­versity of Alberta and confirmed by
the Geological Survey of Canada, Ottawa.  Search for the main mass or masses is

A 54 g stone was found in 1992 by Yannick Dubouloz in a box in the
attic of his late grandmother, who had lived in the town of Annecy,
Haute-Savoie, France. In the box was a handwritten note saying that the stone
was a meteorite that fell in Sologne in 1860. Mineralogy and classification (N.

Classification: Ordinary chondrite (L6)
History: At 6:03 CEST, April 30, 2011, a stone penetrated the edge of a roof and onto a concrete step at a farm in the village of Sołtmany, Poland. It was immediately found by the owners of the farm, alarmed by loud noise. Mr. Roman Rzepka from the nearby town of Giżycko, recognized the stone as meteoritic, and informed scientists. On May 2, fragments of the stone were purchased and distributed among laboratories for examination.
Physical characteristics: The meteorite was broken by the impact into 813 g, 155 g and many smaller pieces. Later the main mass was broken by the finder. Total mass is at least 1066 g. Most pieces have 1-1.5 mm thick fusion crust. The crust is of the same thickness all around the meteorite, what suggests the stone was a single fall. The hole in the roof and the trace of impact onto the step below showed that the fall was nearly vertical. Internally, the stone is nearly white, with clearly visible troilite and FeNi grains (to 3 mm), dispersed uniformly throughout the meteorite. Only a few chondrules are visible.
Petrography: (Łukasz Karwowski, USil) Chondrule and matrix olivines and pyroxenes show homogeneous compositions. Low-Ca pyroxene is usually accompanied by Ca pyroxene. In larger grains of feldspar albitic twinning is visible. Sparse chondrules (to 2 mm) are well crystallized and lack glass. There is accessory F-Cl-bearing apatite. Opaque minerals are represented by troilite, kamacite, taenite, and rare chromite. Small grains of copper are visible in taenite grains.
Geochemistry: Olivine Fa25.6; low-Ca pyroxene Fs21.9Wo1.5; high-Ca pyroxene En46.6Fs8.8Wo44.6; feldspar Ab85Or5An10; kamacite Fe 95.87, Ni 5.23, Co 0.74 wt%; troilite Fe 50.23, S 49.69 wt%. Accessory: chromite, Fe-Cl apatite, metallic Cu in taenite.
Classification: Equilibrated ordinary chondrite (L6), W0, S2.
Specimens: 65g at USil (type specimen). Also 120 g at UTWroc.

Sulagiri, Krishnagiri District, Tamil Nadu, India
Fall: 12 September 12, 2008; 08:30 h (Indian Standard Time) (UT+5.5)
Ordinary chondrite (LL6)
History: On September 12, 2008, around 08.30 h, a meteorite fell from the NW sky and was observed by several people of villages closely located around the town of Sulagiri. A screeching noise was heard coming from the north and a bang was heard subsequently by some eye witnesses. The meteorite fragmented at least once in transit, which led to multiple falls around a cluster of villages, defining an elliptical strewn field measuring 3 km along the NW-SE direction and 1 km across. The sizes of the meteorites increase from W to E. 
Physical characteristics: Seven pieces were retrieved and field data were collected (V. Krishnan and K. Nagarajan, GSI). Three pieces from Adda Gurikki village (12°41′00′′N, 77°57′10′′E), weighing a total of 50 kg (13 kg, 11 kg, and 26 kg), two pieces from Rautapalli village (12°41.53′N, 77°56.67′E), weighing 45 kg (29 kg and 16 kg) and one piece each from Gangapuram (12°41.32′N, 77°55.53′′E) and Addagurikki Kottur (12°41.46′′N, 77°56.88′E), 6 kg each, were recovered. The total mass of the fall is more than 110 kg, the largest reported fall in the Indian subcontinent. The meteorite samples are fresh, light gray colored on broken surfaces and covered by thin, light brownish to dark colored fusion crust on partly broken to complete faces. 
Petrography (Basab Chattopadhyay, GSI): Sulagiri is composed dominantly of olivine and pyroxene. Capyroxene is rare and mostly occurs within low-Ca pyroxene. Troilite is more abundant than Fe-Ni metal. Feldspar grains are common. Chondrules are rare, range from about 200 to 500 μm in diameter and are mostly poorly defined and integrated with the recrystallized matrix. 
Mineral compositions and geochemistry (Basab Chattopadhyay, GSI): Average low-Ca pyroxene is Fs21.9 (N = 86) and olivine is Fa25.4 (N = 54). Feldspar averages Ab83.5An10.6Or5.9. Percent mean deviations (PMD) of Fs in low-Ca pyroxene and Fa in olivine are 2.9 and 2.2, respectively. Shock stage is S2. Bulk chemical composition by XRF and ICP-MS (P. N. Shukla, K. Durga Prasad and S. V. S. Murty, PRL) gives Fe = 18.3%, Ni = 1.03% and Co = 480 ppm. 
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (LL6). Type specimens: Total mass of 110 kg and three thin sections are with GSI.  "

California, United StatesFell: 22 Apr 2012
Classification: Carbonaceous chondrite (C)
History: (P. Jenniskens, SETI): A bright daytime east-to-west moving fireball was seen on April 22, 2012, from locations over California and Nevada between 7:51:10 and 7:51:30 am local daylight time (UT-7). The meteoroid fragmented towards the end of its trajectory. A loud sonic boom was heard in a wide region around Lake Tahoe. Wind gusts were felt and houses shook. At least a kiloton of kinetic energy was released, based on the infrasound signal detected at two stations. Eye witnesses in the townships of Coloma and Lotus, El Dorado County, reported hearing whistling sounds and some smelled a ""welding"" odor. U.S. National Climatic Data Center’s ""NEXRAD"" Doppler weather radar sweeps detected the falling meteorites. In data analyzed by Marc Fries, PSI, and Robert Matson, SAIC, the radar-defined strewn field is centered on the Sutter’s Mill historic site. On April 24, Robert Ward searched under the radar footprint and collected the first 5.5 g meteorite in Henningsen-Lotus Park. Later that day, Peter Jenniskens recovered a crushed 4 g fragment in the parking lot of that same park. A third find was made by Brien Cook, before heavy rain descended on the area in the following two days. After the rains more fragments were found including at the Sutter’s Mill site in the James W. Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park.
Physical characteristics: As of November 27th, 2012, 90 fragments have been recovered with a total mass of 992.5 g. A tally is maintained at the Sutter’s Mill Meteorite Consortium website: http://asima.seti.org/sm/.
Petrography: (M. Zolensky, JSC): A small piece was examined for petrography, taken from the stone found by Jenniskens on the parking lot surface, which had been crushed by an automobile tire and had some adhering terrestrial soil. The meteorite is unusually hard compared to CM2 chondrites, and microprobe totals for the matrix are also high for CM2, suggesting possibly incomplete aqueous alteration or, alternatively, mild thermal metamorphism.  Various coarse-grained components are embedded within an opaque fine-grained matrix including chondrules, fine-grained porous olivine aggregates, fine-grained porous low-Ca pyroxene aggregates, large isolated lithic and mineral fragments (both olivine, low-Ca pyroxene), abundant CAIs, and grains of pyrrhotite and pentlandite. The components are often rimmed by fine-grained dust mantles. Chondrule diameters are generally less than 0.4 mm with a few exceeding 1 mm. Some chondrule contents are partially altered to tochilinite and cronstedtite and/or serpentine. Fe-Ni metal occurs (as a minor constituent) in chondrules and aggregate olivine crystals. The porous aggregates are irregular in shape and measure up to a couple of hundred microns across. The CAI are typical layered CM variety, with spinel cores, diopside rims and cronstedtite or Fe-rich serpentine between. The matrix includes abundant tochilinite intergrown with serpentine with a layered structure.  Veins are present consisting of pyrrhotite, pentlandite, and Fe-Ni-Cr phosphides. One small, embayed grain of oldhamite was observed in matrix.  Several grains of a refractory carbon phase were observed in the matrix, measuring up to 10 µm. No carbonates were observed.
Geochemistry: Most olivines in the chondrules and coarse-grained components are forsterite (below Fa3), but some Fe-rich olivine is present (Fa23). Coarse-grained olivine grains in the matrix are similar, although the iron-rich ones are up to Fa37. Olivine, from 22 analyses, averaged Fa4, with a range Fa1-29. Low-Ca pyroxene, from 19 analyses averaged Fs4Wo2, with a range Fs2Wo1 - Fs7Wo4.
Classification: Carbonaceous chondrite.
Specimens: Current institutional holdings include ASU - 24.9 g, FMNH - 10.1 g, UAz - 15.9, and UNM - 11.0 g.  3 g of the crushed 4 g specimen and a 17 g specimen are located at ARC.

A brilliant fireball followed by loud detonations was widely observed over the Yukon Territory and northern British Columbia.  The fireball was also detected by satellites in Earth orbit.  Dust clouds from terminal fragmentation events were widely observed.  Jim Brook recovered several dozen meteorites totaling ~ 1 kg on the ice of Taku Arm, Tagish Lake, on January 25 and 26 (coordinates of first find given above).  Between April 20 and May 8, ~ 500 additional specimens were located on the ice of Taku Arm and a small, unnamed lake 1.5 km to the east, but only ~ 200 were retrieved as many had melted down into the ice making their collection time consuming; recovery was prioritized based on meteorites' mass and degree of disaggregation.  The total mass collected was between 5 and 10 kg.  The strewnfield is at least 16 × 3 km, oriented approximately S30° E.  Classification and mineralogy (M. Zolensky, JSC; M. Grady, NHM):  possibly CI2 group; a matrix-dominated chondrite, with a few small chondrules, CAIs, and isolated grains; matrix mainly phyllosilicates, Fe-Ni sulfides and magnetite, with abundant Ca-Mg-Fe carbonates; olivine, Fa0–29, PMD = 2%, with a peak at Fa1; pyroxene, Fs1–7, PMD = 2%, with a peak at Fs2; bulk C content 5.4 wt%, with δ13C = +24.3‰; shock stage, S1.  Oxygen isotopes (R. Clayton, UChi):  δ18O = +18.0 to 19.0‰, δ17O = 8.3 to 9.2‰.  Specimens:  majority held by UCalg (contact A. Hildebrand) and UWO (contact P. Brown).  "

The meteorite was found on deck of the ship ""M.S.
CenturyHighway No.1"", which was loading cars in the T-3 berth on
Toyota-pier at Toyohashi harbour (Tahara district). When the crew came back
from lunch after 12:00, they found meteorite fragments spread out from two
impact dents in the steel deck, the larger measuring 20 x 6.5 cm and 3 cm
depth, the smaller 17 cm away from it. From the size of the impact dent the
total weight was estimated to more than 5 kg, but most of it was thrown into
the ocean by the cleaning crew, only about 1 kg are preserved. No sound was
heard accompanying the fall, but during car loading it was very noisy.

Tamdakht, (Ouarzazate) Morocco 
Fall: 20 December 2008, 22:37 hrs (local time; UT+00) 
Ordinary chondrite (H5) 
History (H. Chennaoui-Aoudjehane): On December 20, 2008, witnesses from a number of locations in Morocco (Agadir, Marrakesh, Ouarzazate) observed a meteor with a W to E trajectory. According to the local newspaper, Al Massae (of December 27th), people from the high Atlas Mountains (between Marrakesh and Ouazazate) heard a sound and felt an aftershock. Due to the high relief in this mountain region, covered with snow at this time of the year, searching for the meteorite was a difficult task. The first reports on finding pieces of a meteorite came a couple of weeks later. The largest impact pit is located near Oued Aachir (1.10 m diameter and 70 cm depth, 31°09.8′N, 7°00.9′W), with a stone exceeding 30 kg and many small fragments. A second one is smaller, (about 20 cm diameter and 10 cm depth; 31°09.9′N 07°02.3′W) located 2 km W from the first one; the main mass from the second impact was probably about 500 g. Nine new impacts coordinates have been reported by S. Buhl and M. Aid, and P. Thomas reported 3 other impacts. A strewn field of at least 25 km long and 2 km wide has been outlined. 
Physical characteristics: Total weight is presently estimated to be 100 kg. Pieces recovered as of February 15, 2009, are 30 kg, 1.5 kg, 3.8 kg, 3.69 kg, 2.4 kg, 1.5 kg, 1 kg, 800 g, and 399 g. One major fragment of 1.7 kg and many small pieces from the same stone (ranging 500 to below 1 g) were also recovered. The largest fragment shows a nearly complete dull gray fusion crust, other pieces are 90% crusted to free of crust, often broken along preexisting fractures. Thick fusion crust, locally more than 1 mm. 
Petrography (Albert Jambon, Omar Boudouma, D. Badia UPVI and M. Denise, MNHNP): Abundant chondrules with visible but not well-delimited outlines. Chondrule size is 0.1 to 1.5 mm. Dominant olivine and orthopyroxene. Abundant chromite, rare clinopyroxene and ilmenite. Numerous pockets with chromite, plagioclase and phosphate (merrilite and Cl-apatite). Kamacite, with deformed Neumann bands, and taenite, twinned troilite. Copper. Mode: metal+troilite 10%. 
Mineral compositions and geochemistry: log χ = 5.3. Olivine Fa18 ± 0.5 Opx = En83 Fs16 Wo2 Minor calcic pyroxene. Plagioclase is Ab83–86 An5–15 Or7–2. Ca-phosphate (merrillite and Cl-apatite). Chromite: Cr# (100× molar Cr/[Cr + Al]) = 82. Metal: kamacite with 5% Ni and taenite with 36–47% Ni. Oxygen isotopes (C. Suavet, J. Gattacecca CEREGE): δ17O = 3.26‰, δ18O = 5.01‰, and Δ17O = 0.65‰. Magnetic susceptibility is log χ = 5.3 × 10–9 m3/kg. 
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (H5), S3, W0. 
Type specimens: A mass of 21 g and one polished section provided by P. Thomas are on deposit at UPVI. 1 piece of 15.8 g provided by L. Labenne and small fragments totaling 20 g at UHAC.

Kiambu County, KenyaFell: 16 July 2011
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (L6)
History: A bright fireball in multiple pieces was observed from southern Kenya traveling to the northwest around 10 am on the July 16, 2011. Residents around Kiambu County in the Thika District reported multiple loud explosions and loud screaming noises, with ground shaking. The first piece (~2.5 kg) landed within 1 m of a woman tilling her field in the village of Kihum Wiri (also spelled Kiumwiri). This meteorite was subsequently removed by the military and taken to the University of Nairobi. Multiple pieces were then found in the nearby village of Mwana Wikio. Two meteorites smashed through greenhouses in Mwana Wikio and one through a house in nearby Muguga village. Stones were recovered from a 7.7 × 1.6 km strewnfield bearing N30°W. The main mass, 3.575 kg, was found outside Rose Kamande’s house in Kihum Wiri the day after the fall. Total known mass is currently 14.2 kg totaling 14 individuals, distributed primarily as large stones, e.g., 3575 g, ~2.5 kg, 1.75 kg and 1.3 kg. Only a few small stones have so far been recovered. All stones were recovered before rainfall.
Physical characteristics: Stones are angular and fusion crusted. Interior of the fresh stones is white.
Petrography: Shock stage S1 and weathering W0. One thin shock vein is present in the section, otherwise none are recognizable in the stones. The sections show poorly defined chondrules in a recrystallized matrix. Recognizable chondrules (to 1.6 mm) include BO, RP, and POP. Common accessory minerals include chlorapatite, merrillite, and Ti-rich chromite, and rare ilmenite. Merrillite is particularly abundant with ~50 grains larger than 100 microns on the one-inch-round thin section. Largest merrillite is 600 microns across. Much of the metal and sulfide occurs as separate, blocky grains.
Geochemistry: (Laurence Garvie, ASU) Microprobe analyses show olivine, Fa24.5±0.3 (n=11) and FeO/MnO=50.0 (n=11), pyroxene Fs20.5±0.3Wo1.6±0.5 (n=9), and diopside Fs7.7-8.1Wo45.0 (n=2). Representative analysis of chlorapatite (normalized to three P atoms) is Ca4.93Fe0.02(PO4)3Cl0.71F0.26 and merrillite (normalized to seven P atoms) is Ca8.9Na0.8Mg0.8Fe0.3(PO4)7.
Classification: Ordinary chondrite, L6, S1, W0.
Specimens: ASU holds a 377 g stone (70% fusion crusted), 29.82 g in six pieces, and two thin sections. Farmer holds the 3.575 kg mass and another 3 kg.

extraordinarily loud, 15 s long noise which was heard over a large (100 km
radius) area of Lesotho; the fall was eye-witnessed by several people who
reported sightings of dust trails of “sparkling objects” over Lesotho and the
southern part of the Free State Province of South Africa. Many villagers of Ha
Ralimo, Boqate Ha Majara, and Boqate Ha Sofonia reported falls of stones close
to themselves and onto their homes. The estimated total mass of recovered
material is ~30 kg, including 418 stones in the 2 g to 2.4 kg mass range for a
total of 24.673 kg which were collected and catalogued by A. Ashworth and David

Tata, MoroccoFell: 18 July 2011
Classification: Martian meteorite (Shergottite)
History: (H. Chennaoui Aoudjehane, FSAC, and A. Aaronson) At about 2 am local time on July 18, 2011, a bright fireball was observed by several people in the region of the Oued Drâa valley, east of Tata, Morocco. One eyewitness, Mr Aznid Lhou, reported that it was at first yellow in color, and then turned green illuminating all the area before it appeared to split into two parts. Two sonic booms were heard over the valley. In October 2011, nomads began to find very fresh, fusion-crusted stones in a remote area of the Oued Drâa intermittent watershed, centered about 50 km ESE of Tata and 48 km SSW of Tissint village, in the vicinity of the Oued El Gsaïb drainage and also near El Ga’ïdat plateau known as Hmadat Boû Rba’ ine. The largest stones were recovered in the El Ga’ïdat plateau, whereas the smallest one (a few grams) closer to the El Aglâb Mountains. One 47 g crusted stone was documented as being found at 29°28.917’ N, 7°36.674’ W.
Physical characteristics: Several fusion-crusted stones have been collected ranging from 1 to 987 g, with a total weight of around 7 kg. The stones are almost completely coated by glistening black fusion crust, characterized by thicker layers on exterior ridges as well as much glossier regions (above interior olivine macrocrysts). Some stones have thinner secondary fusion crust on some surfaces.  The crust on some stones has been broken in places to reveal the interior, which appears overall pale gray in color with larger, very pale yellow olivine macrocrysts, and sporadic small pockets and some very thin veinlets of black glass. No terrestrial weathering is evident.
Petrography: (A. Irving and S. Kuehner, UWS): Olivine macrocrysts (to 1.5 mm) and microphenocrysts (to 0.4 mm) are set in a finer groundmass of patchily zoned pyroxene, plagioclase (maskelynite), Ti-poor chromite, ilmenite, pyrrhotite and minor merrillite.  Both the larger olivine macrocrysts and smaller olivine microphenocrysts exhibit thin ferroan rims against the groundmass, and contain tiny chromite inclusions. Narrow ferroan zones also occur within the interior of some olivine macrocrysts.
Geochemistry: Olivine (cores of large macrocrysts Fa19.4-20.2, Fe/Mn=42-44; rims Fa43.2-60.4, Fe/Mn=50-55), cores of microphenocrysts Fa29.1-30.2, Fe/Mn=45-46; rims up to Fa53.3, Fe/Mn=53), orthopyroxene cores (Fs24.0-24.4Wo4.1-4.6, Fe/Mn=30-32), pigeonite (Fs26.1-51.6Wo11.9-16.9, Fe/Mn=31-35), subcalcic augite (Fs21.7-23.3Wo25.0-24.2, Fe/Mn=26-28), plagioclase (An61.1-64.3Or0.5-0.4). Oxygen isotopes (R. Tanaka, OkaU): analyses of acid-washed subsamples by laser fluorination gave, respectively δ17O = 2.849, 2.892; δ18O = 4.844, 4.943; Δ17O = 0.299, 0.290 per mil.  Bulk composition (G. Chen and C. Herd, UAb) ICPMS analysis of powdered interior material gave Sm/Nd=0.646, indicating that this specimen has affinities with the depleted compositional group of shergottites.
Classification: Achondrite (Martian, olivine-phyric shergottite).
Specimens: A total of 30.3 g of type material and one polished thin section are on deposit at UWS.  Other known institutional specimens include 370 g (ASU), 58 g (UAb), and 108 g (UNM).  The remaining material is held by anonymous dealers and collectors.

Ordinary chondrite (L5)
History: A small stone hit the windshield of a car owned by Mr. Rick Wirth of 971 5th Street, Clayton, Wisconsin, USA on the night of 21 October 1996. The stone made a grapefruit-sized fracture in the windshield of the car, which was parked outside Mr. Wirth’s home. On the morning of October 21, one fragment of the stone was discovered lying in the windshield-wiper well, and a second was lying on the snow-covered ground nearby. These two fragments fit together. Lack of fusion crust on one side of the object indicates that a part of the mass was not recovered.
Physical characteristics: The total mass of the two fragments was 89.3 g. The interior of the stone is light gray and includes dark chondrules and metal.
Petrography: (C. Alexander, UMin, G. Huss, UH) Chondrules and matrix show considerable recrystallization. Clinoenstatite grains are abundant. There are no large plagioclase grains. Olivine grains show undulatory extinction and some planar fractures. There is no evidence of weathering.
Mineral compositions and Geochemistry: Mean olivine composition is Fa24.2±0.3. Mean low-Ca pyroxene is Fs20.0±0.3.
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (L5); S3, W1.
Type specimens: The main mass of 84 g is on deposit in the UMin."

Classification: Ordinary chondrite (L5)
History: At about 21:00 UT (around noon local time) on June 19, 2010, a bright fireball was observed over the eastern side of Brazil. Mr. Germano, who lives at the border of Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo, heard several explosions and saw two black objects falling. One ~600 g stone fell about 15 m from him. Early the next day, he found another piece beneath a banana tree. The site of the fall belongs to the city of Varre-sai. The precise location  is about 17 km from Varre-Sai (Rio de Janeiro state) and 8 km from Guaçui (Espírito Santo state). The first piece recovered was about 100 m inside the border of the state of Rio de Janiero.
Physical characteristics: Five masses with a total weight of about 2.5 kg were recovered. Most stones are partly to fully fusion crusted. Broken and cut surfaces are light gray with a few black shock veins.
Petrography: (M.E. Zucolotto, L.L. Antonello, M.E. Varela) Chondrules and chondrule fragments are observed in a recrystallized matrix cut by dark thin veins. Mineralogy dominated by olivine, pyroxene, plagioclase, sulfides and Fe-Ni metal. Olivine shows undulatory extinction and mosaicism. Larger grains show fractures and PDFs. Pyroxenes (mostly orthopyroxene) exhibit similar texture as the olivine. Plagioclase typically  to 50 μm, some showing undulatory extinction, while a few  are twinned. Troilite and Fe-Ni metal occur as irregularly shaped grains. Chondrules range in size from 0.3 to 5 mm, with a mean size of ~0.8 mm. Clearly discernible are a RP (~1.9 mm) and a BO (~2.2 mm) chondrules.
Geochemistry: Mineral compositions and geochemistry: (Magnelli, D, E.and M.E.Varela) Olivine (Fa25.0±0.2, low-Ca pyroxene (Fs21.66±0.2Wo1.49).

In the Catalogue of Meteorites
(Graham et al., 1985) the fall date of the Veramin mesosiderite
is erroneously reported as May 1880. The correct date is 18 April 1880, based
on the detailed account of Ward (1901) and Iranian documents.
The fall of Veramin was first
reported by F. Dietzch, a German mining engineer, who received a piece from the
Shah of Iran in early May 1880. This date was seemingly adopted as the fall
date thereafter, although Dietzch did not imply that himself. According to Ward
(1901) there was a cardboard label beside the meteorite giving an account of
the fall in Farsi (this label is now missing). In translation, Ward (1901)
gives the 8th of Ja­madi-ul-aval A. H. 1298 as the date of the fall. On the basis
of the correlative calendar of Iran, this date is equivalent to 8 April 1881
which is an obvious contradiction to the fact that Dietzch's report was
published in March 1881. Fortunately, a clarifying clue comes from the diary of
the Shah's consultant, M. H. Sanie­o-doleh, which mentions the fall of Veramin
among the events of 1297. If we correct the fall date to the 8th of
Jamadi-ul-aval A. H. 1297, we obtain the fall date of Veramin as 18 April 1880.
This is the date that should be used as a clue to the orbital parameters.
The main mass of Veramin has been
kept in the Golestan Palace, Tehran, since 1880."

Number of individual specimens: 1.
Total weight: Less than one gram.
Circumstances of the fall or discovery: A bright detonating bolide passed directly over the National Research Council auroral observatory at Meanook, Alberta, and was recorded on the all-sky camera as a bright streak with an azimuth of 110°. Its detonations were clearly recorded on the seismograph of the University of Alberta at a distance of 110 km as air blasts. An ellipse of fall was predicted from the photographic record and abundant ground observations of the bolide. The first fragment was recovered by T. Reiruchen a student of the University of Alberta from the surface of two feet of drifted snow. Observors of the fall area heard many fragments whizzing through the air and striking the snow.

Ordinary chondrite (H5) 
History (M. Abu Anbar, TantaU; R. Kryza, UTWroc, T. Przylibski, WTWroc, and G. El Bahariya, TantaU): A bombing sound and cloud of dust was observed in the village during the infall on an apple farm. A crater of 30 × 20 cm and ~10 cm deep. No exact information about the meteorite finder. (probably, the owner of the apple farm). Geologist Mohamed Abu Anbar, TantaU got a few pieces for research from the finder during his visit to the site, shortly after the fall. 
Physical characteristics: Reportedly, five pieces were found, with estimated total mass about 4–5 kg. The diameter of the stone was about 25 cm and it had a light gray color, a brown to black fusion crust ~1 mm thick. 
Petrography: (R. Kryza, UWroc; T. Przylibski, UTWroc) The stone shows a low degree of shock: locally, opaque minerals are fractured and the cracks rarely continue into the neighboring silicates. The matrix (10 vol%) has a fine, inequigranular texture. The main component is olivine, subordinate low-Ca pyroxene and Ca pyroxene. Secondary feldspar grains, 20–90 μm large, are minor. Occasionally apatite is found. Opaque minerals vary between 2 and 15 vol%. Kamacite dominates over taenite, together = 6-8 vol%. Troilite and chromite are also common. The grain sizes of the opaques are 0.01-1.5 mm. Chondrules constitute 60 vol%, with a size range of 0.23-1.86 mm (mean 0.57 mm, standard deviation = 0.33). 
Geochemistry: Olivine (Fo79.7, Fa19.7); pyroxene (Wo1.3En81.0Fs17.7); feldspar (Ab82.8An11.8Or5.4): kamacite (Ni 6.1–9.4 wt%); taenite (Ni = 27.4–51.8 wt%). 
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (H5), S1, W0. 
Type specimens: Main mass of 2 kg (20 cm in length) and 300 g are deposited in GMAlBeda Geological Museum, and 250 g in PDAlBeda; 2 g and four thin sections are deposited in UWroc.

Coordinates that best express the Weston fall are 41°16'N, 73°16'W (see new publication by Robson and Pagliaro 2009). The Weston meteor was observed for approximately ten seconds at 06:00 Eastern Standard Time (11:00 UTC) on 1807 December 14 over New York state and New England. The meteor’s atmospheric trajectory was on a course of 155 degrees azimuth (NW to SE) at a slope to the horizon of 30 degrees. The meteor became visible at an altitude of approximately 84 km and its terminal point was at an altitude of approximately 16 km. A significant fragmentation of the meteoroid occurred in the vicinity of New Milford, Connecticut at an altitude of 30 km. Upper air winds distributed the seven fragments recovered into a classical elliptical pattern (centered on the above given coordinates); the major axis being 12 km and orientated north to south. The total mass is ~20 kg. The main mass landed on a rock outcropping in a pasture in Easton, Fairfield County, Connecticut, within 100 m of 41°12'50"" N and 73°15'43""W. "

Fall: June 23, 2009 at 9:22 p.m. MST (UTC -7 hours)
      Classification: Ordinary chondrite (H5 breccia)


History:  A bright fireball with detonations and rumblings was observed by many witnesses.  Carl Hergenrother  estimated magnitude -11 fireball that created shadows, lasted for at least ~2 seconds moving from the southeast part of the sky to the east and downward.  Part of the path was recorded by the All-Sky camera at the UA-Multiple-Mirror Telescope facility on Mt. Hopkins and a security camera in Marana, AZ.  Jack L. Schrader interviewed eye-witnesses and recovered the first 155.86 g stone on the surface of the high desert less than 45 hours after the fall. Within a month of its fall, additional stones were found by Chuck Schrader, Shauna Russell, Robert Ward, Todd Parker, and Michael Farmer. Strewnfield occupies an ~3 x 6 km ellipse, trending N 30° E. Coordinates given are approximately at the center of the strewnfield. 
Physical characteristics:  Total known mass as of July 15, 2009 is 2138.74 g among 10 stones.  All except one were recovered as intact individuals with complete fusion crust.  Some stones exhibit regmaglypts. Fusion crust is fresh, matte black. One stone exhibits a fusion crust with a reddish hue (not oxidation) and others contain a few “bluish” spots. 
Petrography D. H. Hill (UAz): Well-defined chondrules (200-700 μm) with porphyritic olivine and pyroxene chondrules being most abundant.  Metal grains up to 800 μm and troilite up to 300 μm occur between chondrules in approximately 1:1 proportion.  Many metal grains exhibit fingerlike intergrowth of kamacite and taenite.  Mg-bearing phosphates ~100 x 200 μm occur between chondrules.  A crushed texture is observed that corresponds to a lighter lithology in a darker groundmass.  Shock veins are visible in the hand specimen.  There are two 350 μm chromite-rich clasts.
Mineral compositions and geochemistry: D. H. Hill (UAz) EMP: Olivine (Fa18.82±0.25); pyroxene (Fs16.56±0.49Wo1.77±1.7); kamacite (Ni 6.71% ± 0.28; Co 0.49% ± 0.03), taenite (26% Ni and ~40 % Ni (tetrataenite?); phosphates are mostly Mg-rich with a few Cl-bearing.   
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (H5) breccia; W0Type specimens: A total sample mass of 20.36 g is on deposit at UAz and 131 g at ASU. Jack L. Schrader holds 787.92 g; Chuck Schrader holds 99.61 g; Shauna Russell holds 465.83 g; Ward holds 397 g; Todd Parker holds 218 g.

Find: January 28, 2005
Ordinary chondrite (LL3)
History: Annick Goueslain and Jean Luc Parodi discovered two stones in the Mauritanian Sahara while searching for meteorites.
Physical characteristics: The two fresh-looking stones are partially covered with fusion crust; their masses are 145 and 114.3 g, respectively.
Petrography: (M. Bourot-Denise, MNHN) The chondritic texture is intact, and opaques are present as nodules interspersed between chondrules; large type II chondrules are by far the most abundant among chondrules and very big (0.5->1 cm in size); white, pyroxene chondrules are especially common; in type I porphyritic chondrules, no FeO zoning is seen in olivine. Matrix in between chondrules is most of the time pervaded by a mixture of silicate-, metal-, and sulfide-forming droplets (melted material) in the vicinity of large opaque grains.
Geochemistry: Olivine (Fa10.4±12.2, range Fa0.72-39.8; CaO content up to 0.6 and Cr2O3 content up to 0.55 [both in wt%]); low-Ca pyroxene (Fs14.1±6.5, range Fs4.1-21.2).
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (LL3; estimated subtype 3.2); S4, W2.
Type specimens: A total of 21 g of sample and four polished mounts are on deposit at MNHN. In addition, MNHN holds a nearly complete stone of 120.8 g. Goueslain and Parodi hold the remaining mass."

Classification: Iron meteorite (IIAB)
History: (H. Chennaoui Aoudjehane, M. Aboulahris, FSAC) Two small pieces of iron were collected in 2000 in the Agoudal area, High Atlas Mountains, Morocco, and sold to tourists. In September 2011, one piece was sold to a dealer in Errich, who recognized it as an iron meteorite. During the last months of 2012, systematic searching by meteorite hunters with metal detectors resulted in the discovery of a large number of meteorites, mostly small. Many pieces were collected on the surface or buried a few cm deep. The largest piece recovered was 60 kg, buried ~50 cm below the surface. On 9 February 2013, H. Chennaoui Aoudjehane, M. Aoudjehane and M. Aboulahris collected 200 g of specimens; the listed coordinates are those of the largest piece they recovered. The strewnfield is not yet clearly defined.
Physical characteristics: Total mass is >100 kg. Hundreds of small pieces (1-100 g), many 100-1000 g, and a few pieces >1 kg, have been recovered. The majority of collected material occurs as 2-5 cm, irregularly shaped shrapnel pieces. Most pieces have a thin weathering rind. Some smaller bullet-shaped (~cm-sized) fragments are rounded, showing well-developed fusion crust.
Petrography: (L. Garvie, ASU) Decimeter-sized pieces show a coarse pattern of irregular, interlocking kamacite grains; some grains with sub-boundaries. Widmanstätten pattern not evident in the small sections studied. Grain boundaries commonly curved. Etched pieces range from shiny with well-developed Neumann bands, to pieces with a matte appearance, typical of the hatched ε-structure. The shock-hatched regions show incipient recrystallization, with secondary growth of irregularly-shaped (to 1 mm) kamacite. No plessite observed. Schreibersite abundant occurring as cm-sized skeletal crystals at the centers of kamacite crystals, as rhabdites, and as a grain boundary precipitate. Rhabdites locally numerous as sharp, 10-25 μm faceted prisms. Scattered troilite nodules, to 1 cm. Troilite not surrounded by schreibersite, but instead large skeletal schreibersite is situated a few mm away. Heat-affected zone visible on some stones. Several of the smaller pieces, and especially the rounded bullet-shaped stones, have fusion crust and heated-affected zone of varying thickness; some completely recrystallized.
Geochemistry: (C. Herd and G. Chen, UAb): ICP-MS data, Ni 5.5 wt%, Co 4.1 mg/g, Ga 58 μg/g, Ir < 0.04 μg/g and Au ~ 1 μg/g.
Classification: Iron, IIAB. Structurally similar to Ainsworth.
Specimens: Type specimens include 2406 g, ASU; 17.5 g, UAb; 200 g, FSACOther names: This meteorite has been sold and traded under the name ""Imilchil""

History: Several tons of this material have been found on the ground or by digging near Al Haggounia, Morocco (Chennaoui et al. 2007) for description of the strewn field) and sold to several dealers. The coordinates are given for the center of the strewn field, which extends ~ 40 km.
Physical characteristics: It is impossible to assess precisely the amount of material already (and to be) recovered, but according to dealers, collectors, and Jambon it is about 3 metric tons composing many samples of varied sizes (from a few g to 50 kg). The largest stones were recovered after excavating them from the ground. The outer surface is rusty brown due to severe alteration. Looks like a sedimentary breccia cemented by iron oxide and carbonate. Color changes from bluish gray to rusty brown closest to the fractures are observed. Yellow patches of sulfur (alteration) are widespread. The rocks are significantly porous with pore sizes from several cm to hundreds of microns.
Petrography: (A. Jambon, O. Boudouma and D. Badia. UPVI) Dominated by enstatite and plagioclase. Troilite, graphite daubreelite, oldhamite, kamacite rich in Si and schreibersite are present.
Mineral compositions: Enstatite (En98Fs1Wo1) and plagioclase (Ab78An16Or5).
Classification: Achondrite (aubrite); extensive weathering. Similar to and likely paired with NWA 002, 1067, 2736, 2828, 2965. 
Type specimens: A total of 50 g of sample and three polished sections are on deposit at UPVI.
Main masses: Beroud, 3886 g (26 pieces from 1185 g to 5.8 g); PThomas, 4497 g (33 pieces from 11 to 1507 g); Hmani, about 500 kg; Ouzrou, about 500 kg. "

Achondrite (lunar, mare basalt/gabbro breccia)
History: Nomads from near Anoual (a village located in the east of Morocco between Bouarfa and Talsint; about 40 km ENE of the latter) learned that the small odd stones that had been found close to their settlement in June and July of 2005 were indeed a meteorite from the Moon (NWA 2727). After extensive searching and screening of the soil, Mr. Boujena recovered 12 pieces for a total mass of 5.92 g, over an area about 5 m in diameter. The small size of the pieces can be explained by the brecciated character of the stone. Ph. Thomas visited the place in May 2006 and May 2007, participated in the search, took pictures, in particular of the investigated soil, and registered the GPS coordinates.
Physical characteristics: Tan greenish stones devoid of fusion crust.
Petrography: (A. Jambon, O. Boudouma, and D. Badia. UPVI). Breccia composed dominantly of two lithologies: A phyric basalt and a gabbro. Basalt with subhedral olivine phenocrysts (<1 mm; 20 vol%) slightly resorbed in a finely crystallized groundmass. Highly fractured gabbro clasts. Small doleritic clasts with zoned pyroxenes. Mafic areas of once molten rock with olivine needles. One clast of quenched basaltic melt with numerous zirconolite needles (0.7 vol%; 0.1 mm) silica and celsian K-feldspar. Ilmenite, troilite, chromite. Plagioclase and clinopyroxene. Carbonate fills the largest fractures.
Geochemistry: (EMPA) Olivine (Fa45-28, with few crystals >Fa45; FeO/MnO = 97). Pyroxene: from (Mg# = 0.80) pigeonite (Wo10) and augite (Wo45) to pyroxferroite (Fs70Wo25; FeO/MnO = 70). Plagioclase (An91-83). Spinel (Cr66Sp25Us3Mt6).
Classification: Achondrite (lunar, mare basalt/gabbro breccia). Paired with NWA 2727/3160 (and potentially NWA 3333).
Type specimens: A total of 1.205 g of sample (one polished section) is on deposit at UPVI. Thomas holds the main mass.

Arizona, USAFound: prior to 2005
Classification: Iron meteorite (IIIAB)
History: Purchased by Carleton Moore from the finder in Apache Junction.
Physical characteristics: A single, ellipsoidal (34 × 15 × 12 cm) 25 kg mass reportedly found near the intersection of McKellips Rd. and Ironwood Dr. in the city of Apache Junction, Arizona. The surface of the meteorite exhibits shows minor rusting, and well-developed regmaglypts.
Petrography: (Laurence Garvie, ASU) Medium octahedrite (bandwidth 0.85±0.15). Kamacite with a cross-hatched pattern abundant. Taenite and plessite common (visually ~25% by area). Neumann bands weakly developed. A few long thin Reichenbach lamellae on each slice. Individual lamellae can be followed through several slices and together these lamella form a trapezoid - parallel sides are 35 and 15 mm long and height of ~20 mm. Typical lamella is a 100 μm thick plate of chromite (determined by powder XRD). Some lamellae bordered by troilite and irregular masses of attached schreibersite. Schreibersite (to 500 μm) present in the interiors of kamacite bands. Chromite also present as rare, to 1 mm, euhedral grains with schreibersite. Only one troilite nodule (12x8 mm) present; exhibits a discontinuous schreibersite rim and well-developed swathing kamacite. Traces of heat affected zone present.
Geochemistry: Composition as determined by INAA (J.T. Wasson, UCLA) - Ni 83.9 mg/g; Co 5.28 mg/g; Cr 18 μg/g; Cu 136 μg/g; Ga 20.1 μg/g; As 8.3 μg/g; Ir 0.192 μg/g; Pt 5.7 μg/g; Au 1.153 μg/g; W 0.53 ng/g, and Re <20 ng/g.
Classification: The meteorite is a member of IIIAB. Its nearest North American relatives are El Capitan (0.12 μg/g Ir) and Asarco Mexicana (0.27 μg/g Ir), but the compositional differences are large enough to make it unlikely that it is paired with either of these or with any other well-characterized IIIAB iron.
Specimens: A total of 1500 g are on deposit at ASU.

Classification: Ordinary chondrite (H6)
History: The meteorite was found by Myke Steighler while  hunting for meteorites on alluvial flats southwest of Standard Wash, Lake Havasu City, Arizona. The meteorite was observed amongst desert-varnished stones.
Physical characteristics: Single, smooth, 560.8 g trapezoidal stone, remant fusion crusted. Interior shows two distinct zones: upper 3/4 is light-colored and shows minor weathering (W1), and bottom quarter (presumably embedded in the ground), heavily weathered (W4). Junction between fresh and weathered portions is sharp.
Petrography: (L. Garvie, ASU): The unweathered part is largely recrystallied, vuggy, with a few recognizable chondrules including BO, PP, and RP (mostly <1 mm). The studied section contains one large, 2.5 mm, barred-olivine chondrule, with the bars arranged in a pentagonal shape. The matrix minerals protruding into the vugs are often euhedral.  Plagioclase and chromite abundant, to 300 μm. Kamacite (<1 mm) common, with rare plessite grains (<50 μm). Troilite grains untwinned and single crystal. Minor Cl-phosphate grains to 250 μm. Olivines show sharp optical extinction.
Geochemistry: Olivine Fa18.9±0.3 (range Fa18.4-19.4, n=12), FeO/MnO=39.9±2.7. Low Ca pyroxene Fs16.6±0.1Wo1.4±0.1, n=6. Augite Fs6.2-6.3Wo45.3, n=2. Feldspar An12.6Or5.0, n=1.

Classification and thin section analysis by Simon et al. (1994a) and Casanova
and Simon (1994): olivines and low-Ca pyroxenes average Fay and Fs1,
respectively, texture and oxygen isotope ratios (anlysis R. N. Clayton) are
much like those of Allende. However, Axtell shows pervasive weathering of
matrix minerals and has a 60Co concentration and refractory inclusions that are
unlike those of typical Allende specimens. Natural and induced thermoluminescence
data are also consistent with this meteorite not being paired with Allende; see

Iron ungrouped (ataxite)
A single mass of 860 g was
found by farmer Clemente Allini while he was ploughing a cornfield. In 1972,
young Carla Allini showed it at school to her teacher, who submitted it to Professor
G. Giuseppetti at the University of Pavia. In 1974, he inspected the meteorite macroscopically
and obtained bulk data by atomic absorption spectroscopy and traditional wet
chemistry, and identified it as an unusually Ni-rich iron meteorite. Classification
and mineralogy (A. Fioretti, UPad; V. de Michele, Milano):
ataxitic texture, lacking Widmannstätten pattern; consists almost entirely of
taenite (Ni27) with minor plates of kamacite and accessory troilite and
schreibersite; severely altered surface, but fresh interior. Bulk metal
composition (B. Spettel, W. Huisl and J. Zipfel, MPI): Ni = 27.1 wt%; Ge
= 73 µg/g; Ga = 28 µg/g; As = 16.6 µg/g; composition falls at the Nirich end of
the IAB-IIICD trends, with Ga and Ge concentrations comparable to those of the
Ni-rich IAB’s San Cristobal and Yamato 791694 and to the ungrouped iron
Elephant Moraine (EET) 87506, but with lower As than any of these meteorites;
based on mineralogical and chemical data the meteorite is classified as an
ungrouped iron. See also Fioretti et al. (2001). Specimens: main mass
and type specimen, 479 g, Milano.

Macroscopic Description: Kathleen McBride
The exterior is 100% fully covered with fusion crust. It has no chips or cracks and looks as though it fell to earth yesterday. The fusion crust is black, glassy and has a ropy texture. The interior has a sandy texture, tan in color giving the appearance similar to sandstone. Binocular microscope shows dense, fine-grained clear yellow (citrine colored) and root beer colored crystals. There are some black mineral grains as well. This meteorite was much more dense and difficult to break than most other similar looking stones.

Stredocesky, Czech RepublicFound: 9 Apr 2011; possibly fell 7 May 1991
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (LL3.5)
History: A -19.5 absolute magnitude fireball was recorded by 3 all-sky and 2 spectral cameras at 3 Czech stations of the European Fireball Network on May 7, 1991, at 23:03:48 UT. Data on atmospheric trajectory, heliocentric orbit, fragmentation history, composition and possible impact location were subsequently determined (Spurny, 1994; Borovicka and Spurny, 1996; Borovicka et al. 1998a; Borovicka et al. 1998b). Despite great efforts no meteorite was found in the weeks and years after the fall. The fireball observations were re-analyzed by P. Spurny in 2011 and a revised impact location was determined. The new impact area was probed using metal detectors and three small meteorites were discovered - two named as Benešov (a) and one named as Benešov (b). The two Benešov (a) fragments were 250 m apart. Benešov (b) was found between them.
Physical characteristics: Weathered fragments lacking fusion crust. The meteorites resemble the terrestrial stones and slag found in the field.
Petrography: (Jakub Haloda, PCU) The meteorite is a polymict breccia containing two lithologies with different texture, chemical, and mineralogical compositions. The largest portion is an LL3.5 chondrite. An achondritic clast was also found within the thick section. This clast (4.8 × 2.6 mm) is cemented to the LL3.5 chondrite lithology by an irregular vein of impact melt. Olivine, pyroxene and plagioclase in the LL3.5 lithology show weak shock features corresponding to shock stage S3. The achondritic clast shows features corresponding to stage S4 (olivine mosaicism, plagioclase is partly isotropic).
Geochemistry: LL3.5: The chondrules and matrix are unequilibrated. Chondrules (0.2-1.9 mm) consist mostly of olivine (Fa6-32), low-Ca pyroxene (Fs1-37Wo0.7-3) and alkali-bearing glass exhibiting a wide range of chemical compositions. The chondrule olivine contains on average 0.08 wt% Cr2O3. Type I chondrules contain 0.17 to 1.1 wt% CaO and Type II 0.04 to 1.1 wt%. Fine-grained matrix contains olivine (Fa21-40), low-Ca pyroxene (Fs1-32 Wo0.7-3.5), predominately weathered alkalic glass, Fe-Ni phases and troilite. The achondritic lithology is composed predominantly of olivine (Fo90-69) and low-Ca pyroxene (En79-65Wo1.2-4.8). Anorthitic plagioclase (An86-82Ab18-14) and high-Ca pyroxene (En56-48Wo43-32) are also present.
Classification: Polymict breccia, LL3.5 with achondritic clast.
Specimens: 7.72 g (LL3.5 with achondritic clast), 1.99 g (LL3.5), both at CzAS

Manitoba, CanadaFound: October 2002
Classification: Iron meteorite (IAB-MG)
History: In October 2002, the discovery of two irregularly shaped meteorite fragments weighing 5.5 and 4.3 kg was reported to the Prairie Meteorite Search (run by the Universities of Calgary, Western Ontario and Regina) by Derek Erstelle from Winnipeg, Manitoba. The discovery site is east of Lac du Bonnet, 3.6 km from the junction with Highway 315 along the Tanco Mine Road. Bernic Lake, the site of the Tanco Mine, is the nearest geographical feature and is the source of the name. The two fragments were found in a sandy area within 5 m of each other.
Physical characteristics: The two specimens are heavily weathered to reddish-brown oxides that penetrate along fractures into the interior
Petrography: (S. Kissin, LHU) Etched sections show average bandwidth of 4.3 ± 1.3 mm (n=19). Kamacite lamellae are stubby and irregular, and contain abundant Neumann lines. Taenite is limited to minute lamellae and blebs. Schreibersite is present as sparse Brezina lamellae and rhabdites.
Geochemistry: (S. Kissin, LHU): Ni = 65, Co = 4.3 (both mg/g); Cu = 130, Ga = 83, Ge = 353, As = 11.3, Ir = 3.32, Pt = 6.5, and Au = 1.4 (all in μg/g) obtained by INAA (Actlabs)
Classification: Iron meteorite, IAB-MG, coarsest octahedrite (S. Kissin, LHU)
Specimens: Two main masses, 5086 g and 4076 g, were acquired by the ROM. A 444 g slice was removed from the larger mass and transferred to UAb.

Classification: Ordinary chondrite (L4)
History: The first piece was found on the Nullarbor Plain by A. Langendam. A further 16 fragments were located within a 30 m radius of the initial find.
Physical characteristics: Combined weight of all 17 pieces is 103.4 g, with the largest piece measuring 5 x 4 x 1 cm. The weathered surface is dark brown to black with small patches of orange lichens. Several pieces fit together like a jigsaw.
Petrography: (Kim Lai N. Bell, Monash) Main mass contains up to 65% chondrules within a dark, heavily rusted matrix. Mineralogy consists of olivine, pyroxene, minor plagioclase, Fe-Ni metal and sulfides. The dominant minerals, olivine and pyroxene, are mostly found in chondrules, with smaller grains (<50 µm) in the matrix. Plagioclase occurs in minor amounts and rarely exceeds 50 μm. Chondrules lack glass, are easy to discern and sometimes rimmed by sulfides or olivine. Chondrule types include RP, POP, GOP, PO and BO, with sizes ranging 0.1-2 mm and averaging 0.4 mm. Olivine and pyroxene grains display irregular to undulose extinctions, with larger grains containing planar fracturing. Up to 97% of all Fe-Ni metals and troilite are replaced by oxides.
Geochemistry: EMPA (wt%) Olivine: SiO2 = 38.25, TiO2 = 0.02, Al2O3 = 0.02, FeO = 24.94, MnO = 0.45, MgO = 37.47, CaO = 0.05, Na2O = 0.01, K2O = 0.01, (Fa = 25.6 mol%, σ = 2.5, n = 6).

Rumuruti chondrite (R3-6)
History: Discovered on a dry lakebed by Ralph Clary, while he was hunting meteorites.
Physical characteristics: 31 minimally fusion-crusted fragments totaling 70 g were found.
Petrography: (T. McCoy and L. Welzenback, SI). The sample is brecciated, with several 1-4 mm chondritic clasts of variable petrologic type. Approximately 50 vol% consists of well-defined chondrules (up to 1 mm, including PO, PP, BO, C, RP), mineral grains and chondritic fragments (mixed petrologic type up to 6) in a fine-grained silicate matrix. Minor, fine-grained Fe,Ti oxides and sulfides occur scattered throughout the meteorite.
Mineral compositions and Geochemistry: Olivine and pyroxene grains were analyzed by EMP. Olivines are nearly homogeneous (Fa38±1.5, with a small tail of analyses down to Fa10) and pyroxenes exhibit a larger range (Fs5-31).
Classification: Rumuruti chondrite (R3-6); moderate shock and minimal weathering (sulfides are well preserved).
Type specimens: A 13.3 g sample and one thin section are deposit at SI. Main mass is located at TCU.

Find: Fall 1996 
Ordinary Chondrite (H4) 
History: Over 30 fragments scattered over 100 m radius were collected from the surface of Pliocene sediments, with which they bear no apparent relationship, and none were found in situ. The meteorite fragments were discovered and collected by Prof. Tim White of the Department of Integrative Biology, University of California at Berkeley, in the fall of 1996 and subsequently, in the framework of the Middle Awash Project (see Asfaw et al. 2002). A total of 9.1 kg with one piece weighing more than 5 kg was collected and none is left in the field. All meteorite fragments are stored at the National Museum of Ethiopia (NME) in Addis Ababa. Dr. Giday WoldeGabriel took a fragment weighing about 40 g to the United States for characterization. Recently Dr. Tamrat Endale took an additional fragment (35 g) for analysis at CEREGE, France. 
Results from Los Alamos National Laboratory: Preliminary petrographic analysis indicates thermally metamorphosed, strongly fractured, and altered coarse mafic minerals embedded in highly weathered metallic oxide. The bulk chemistry is SiO2 (34.7 wt%), iron oxide (Fe2O3T = >33 wt%), and MgO (22 wt%). Neutron activation analysis yielded Ni (13,747 ppm) and Cr (3516 ppm). 
Physical characteristics: The exterior of the specimen is weathered but shows a glassy fusion crust. The interior is black-brown with visible metal and chondrules. Magnetic susceptibility is logχ = 4.68 (10–9 m3/kg), in agreement with a weathered H. 
Petrography: (M. Bourot-Denise, MNHNP, J. Gattacceca, CEREGE) microscopic observation of a polished section reveals a chondrite texture. Chromite-plagioclase assemblages are present. Metallic copper is found associated with taenite-kamacite grains. Weathering grade is estimated to be W4 in the MNHNP sample and W6 in the Los Alamos sample examined by M. Killgore. 
Mineral compositions and geochemistry: Olivine is homogeneous (Fa20.1 ± 0.4%,) and low Ca pyroxene displays the typical scatter for a type 4 chondrite (Fs14.8 ± 3.8%). 
Classification: H4, W4, S4. 
Type specimens: The type specimens include a 15 g piece on deposit at CEREGE and the main mass of ≥9 kg at the National Museum of Ethiopia (NME), Addis Ababa. "

Taylor County, Texas, United StatesFound: 2003
Classification: Iron meteorite (IAB, ungrouped)
History:  A single 9.3 kg mass was found by Kevin Halliburton in 2003. It was found lying on a section of exposed limestone bedrock on his property, in the vicinity of limestone rubble presumed to have been moved from a nearby road-cut.  Mr. Halliburton recognized the unusual appearance and density of the rock.  Noting that it was magnetic and possessed other qualities common to iron meteorites, he suspected that it might be a meteorite and contacted A. Rubin at UCLA.
Physical characteristics:  The 9.3 kg mass is of irregular shape, and measures 21 × 15 × 9 cm at its widest points.  It is lightly weathered and displays well defined regmaglypts, but no fusion crust remains.  Minor caliche is present on the underside of the specimen, and over twenty (presumably troilite) inclusions are visible on its surface. 
Petrography: (J. Wasson, UCLA) Two pieces, weighing 15.7 and 18.7 grams, were examined.  An area ~15×20 mm on the smaller sample was polished and etched.  It shows a well defined Widmanstätten pattern with kamacite rimmed by bright taenite borders. The kamacite is swollen with mean width 1.3±0.1 mm, on the border between Om and Og but probably on the Om side.  Occasional schreibersites are scattered throughout the kamacite.  The larger sample displays an 8 ×10 mm FeS nodule ringed by a 0.2-0.3 mm thick rim of schreibersite.  The composition of the iron is almost identical to that of the IAB ungrouped FeS-rich iron Waterville, an iron with an exceptionally high content of FeS. Considering the large amount of FeS visible on the surface of the main mass, this iron would appear to be a new member of the Mundrabilla grouplet in the IAB complex.
Geochemistry: Bulk Composition: INAA data (J. T. Wasson, UCLA): Co = 4.8 mg g-1, Ni = 80 mg g-1, Cu = 212 mg g-1, Ga = 75 μg g-1, Ge = 280 μg g-1, As = 16 μg g-1, Ru = 4.9 μg g-1, Sb = 410 ng g-1, W = 0.86 μg g-1, Ir = 0.44 μg g-1, Au = 1.64 μg g-1.
Classification: Iron meteorite, ungrouped member of the IAB complex, medium octahedrite; member of the Mundrabilla grouplet.
Specimens: Type  specimen, 33 g, UCLA; main mass, JUtas.

Eagle County, Colorado, USAFound: July 2003
Classification: Iron meteorite (IIIAB)
History: In July 2003, Gene Killinen was practicing with his new metal detector at his family’s hunting cabin near Burns, Colorado.  Gene found a strong signal in the area immediately in front of the cabin. He and his father excavated a mass from a depth of roughly 60-90 cm. They surmised that the large, heavy object might be a meteorite, but they were uncertain.  A year later they took the object to Fort Lewis College, where a nickel test was performed, with positive results.  A sample was sent to Randy Korotev, WUSL, who confirmed that the specimen was a meteorite and an octahedrite. Anne Black purchased the meteorite in September of 2006, and it was subsequently sold to Peter Utas at the Tucson Gem and Mineral Show in 2007.
Physical characteristics: The meteorite weighs approximately 18.4 kg and has a flattened, highly irregular shape, and craggy surface covered with a thin layer of oxide and caliche.  Several phosphide and sulfide inclusions are visible on the surface.
Petrography: Bandwidth ~0.24±0.05 mm, thus Of. Recrystallized, 0.2 × 0.04 kamacite grains in many plessite fields, borders of kamacite bands are ragged, not straight. Schreibersite is present on centers of many bands, mostly reaching sizes of 0.2-0.5 long by 0.05-0.1 thick. One hieroglyphic schreibersite 2 mm thick by 16 mm long, is sandwiched by swathing kamacite bar that reaches a thickness of 6 mm. Several kamacite recrystallized with some tiny taenites (or schreibersites). Weathering moderate, but confined to surface and near surface. No FeS recognized. No heat altered zone.
Geochemistry: Composition: 5.69  mg/g Co, 103.7 mg/g Ni,  14.4 μg/g Ga,  ~28 μg/g Ge,  23.4 μg/g As, 0.022 μg/g Ir, and 2.588 μg/g Au.  Burns falls near the high-Au extreme of group IIIAB; it has the second highest Au and Ni, the third-highest As and the highest Co in the UCLA IIIAB data set. The Saint-Aubin meteorite has the highest Au, Ni and As contents. The other irons that are closely similar to these two are Tieraco Creek, Thurlow and Bella Roca.
Classification: IIIAB
Specimens: 80 g at UCLA.

History: Recovered in 1992 by Richard Wagner of Burstall, Saskatchewan, Canada, and donated to the GSC.
Physical characteristics: The total mass of the meteorite is 360 g. The exterior of the specimen is weathered and shows no remaining fusion crust. The interior of the sample shows oxidation along the boundaries of kamacite lamellae. Oxidation of a freshly cut surface proceeded rapidly, suggesting the presence of chloride and interaction with groundwater.
Petrography: (S. A. Kissin, LHU) The cut surface and a polished section display mostly kamacite lamellae, separated by narrow, remnant taenite lamellae.
Mineral compositions and Geochemistry: (INAA, ActLab) Ni = 6.57 wt%, Ge = 334 ppm, Ga = 80.4, Ir = 2.24 ppm.
Classification: Iron meteorite (IAB complex), a coarse octahedrite (Og).

Classification: Iron meteorite (IIIAB)
History:  A single 148 kg mass was found by Guy Hutcherson in the late 1960s, while hunting with his son, Robert Hutcherson, on their property, north of Ranch Road 337 between the towns of Camp Wood and Leakey.  Noting its unusual appearance and metallic quality, they exhumed the partially buried mass and brought it home, where it remained until 2007, a presumed meteorite.  In 2007 a 28.6 gram sample was sent to NASA, forwarded to the Smithsonian and confirmed to be a meteorite.
Physical characteristics:  The mass is irregularly shaped, and measures approximately 50×48×30 cm at its widest points.  Its surface is moderately weathered and is dominated by numerous well-defined shallow depressions ranging from 5 to 20 cm in diameter that appear to be due to the effects of weathering.  No fusion crust remains.
Petrography: (J. Wasson, UCLA) No widmanstätten figures were visible on a small etched surface, but some kamacite lamellae could be recognized because the meteorite had oxidized along kamacite boundaries and some conversion of kamacite into oxide occurred.  The mean bandwidth is 0.9±0.1 mm, Om.  No schreibersite, troilite, or other inclusions were observed in the sample.
Geochemistry: Bulk Composition: INAA data (J. Wasson, UCLA): Co = 5.0 mg/g, Ni 74 mg/g, Cu = 154 μg/g, Ga = 18.4 μg/g, As, 3.4 μg/g, Ru = 13 μg/g, W = 1.2 μg/g, Ir = 12.1 μg/g, Pt = 15 μg/g, Au = 0.566 μg/g.

Classification: Iron meteorite (ungrouped)
History: Some miners were prospecting ores, when one of them, Mr. Laert, commented that he had found a ""steel stone"" some years ago. They went to the site and using a metal detector discovered the half-buried mass near a pond. Mr. Rosy suspected it to be a meteorite and asked permission of the landowner to remove part of the mass. Mr. Diniz contacted the Museu Nacional, Rio de Janeiro, where it was confirmed to be a meteorite. The farmer removed and kept the rest of the stone.
Physical characteristics: A large pear shaped mass of about 2 tons with no fusion crust or regmaglypts.
Petrography: (M. E. Zucolotto, MNRJ) Etched sections shows a Widmanstätten pattern with an average bandwidth of 1.3 ± 0.2 mm. The kamacite has decorated subboundaries and numerous fine 1 to 5 µm phosphides in the interior. Neumann lines are common in a few kamacite lamellae. Taenite and plessite covers 5-15% by area as comb and net plessite fields;  large taenite decomposed to martensitic pattern.  Schreibersite occurs as skeletal crystals or on grain boundaries. Rhabdites are common and scattered in kamacite. No large inclusions were present in the sample analyzed, although the presence of the swathing kamacite around some holes suggests the presence of inclusions removed during the cutting process.
Geochemistry: (J.T. Wasson, UCLA). Co = 5.8, Ni = 71 (both mg/g); Cu = 92,  Ga = 74, Ge = 610,  As = 12.2, Ru = 26, W = 3.05, Re = 1.9,  Ir = 19.6, Pt = 33  and  Au = 1.3 (all in µg/g) obtained by INAA
Classification: Iron meteorite (ungrouped), coarse octahedrite (J.T. Wasson, UCLA).
Specimens: A total sample mass of 26.2 g is on deposit in MNRJ, and 70.0 g on deposit
at UAb, including a 49.2 g slice.  The main mass is in Campinorte with an anonymous owner.

of the fall or discovery: The meteorite was discovered by Dr. Vagn Buchwald
 (Copenhagen, Denmark), during a study of the loc­ality where the Greenland meteorites were previously discovered. It was 6 km to the west of the point where
the two known specimens «Woman» and  «Dog» were found and is undoubtedly a part
of the Cape York me­teorite shower. The meteorite lay on an ice-free slope 500
m from the shore and was partly covered with gneiss boulders. There was no
crater and no crushing of rocks discovered. The meteorite has temporarily been
left where disco­vered. The specimen found is the sixth from the Cape York me­teorite shower. Dr. Vagn Buchwald has drawn up a summary of precise data on
all the known specimens as of September 1963.

later acquired by a meteorite collector and samples given to NAU in 1998
and pieces to AMNH in 1992 and 1993. Classification and mineralogy (M.
Zolensky JSC; T. Bunch NAU): olivine ranges from Fa1 to Fa64,
with a peak at Fa1–2, average Fa1.2, PMD 11%. Low Ca pyroxene ranges from
Fs2Wo5 to Fs5Wo4, also present are diopside, enstatite-diopside, pigeonite, and
chromite. Porphyritic olivine, barred olivine and granular olivine crystals are
most abundant, maximum chondrule diameter is 2 mm. Chondrules are sparse,
matrix and chondrule rims comprise ~85 vol% of the meteorite. The percentage of
matrix is similar to that of Bells and Nogoya, but the composition of these is
lower in S and Mg, and higher in Si; this could be due to terrestrial
weathering. Specimens: type specimen 21 g AMNH; 7.1 g NAU.

weight: Approximately 283 kg.; the dimensions are approximate­ly 55 x 54 x
60 cm.
Circumstance
of the fall or discovery: The meteorite was recovered while plowing the
surface material overlying the formation of late tertiary age.. Apparently the
meteorite has been fallen so long that. there were no indications of a crater.
The plow, which was set to stir the soil to a depth of about 25 cm, broke
when it hit the heavy meteorite.  One side of the meteorite is a smooth dome;
this face apparently was the leading side. All the other surfa­ces on this
stone are covered with fragments which became firmly attached to the meteorite
probably by terrestrial weathering. The centers of these fragments found to be
unaltered. A considerable amount of ni­ckel iron is included in the ground
mass; troilite is also present. The Clovis meteorite could be a piece of one of
the Grady meteorites or the Melrose meteorite, now known front Curry County. The Clovis meteorite is now in the collections of the U. S. National Museum (Washington, USA).

Missouri, USAFound: 2006
Classification: Pallasite (Main group, anomalous)
History: A single mass was discovered protruding from a hillside near Conception Junction, Missouri.
Physical characteristics: The exterior of the meteorite is weathered. Much of the interior shows only minor oxidation.
Petrography: Meteorite has a typical main-group pallasite (PMG) structure with roughly equal portions of metal and silicate. The olivine masses are slightly rounded, though a few surfaces show sharply defined angles. Olivines show millimeter-scale fractures. Schreibersite is rare, perhaps 0.5% of the exposed (25 cm2 surface). Minor FeS.
Geochemistry: Compositional data: Co 6.0 mg/g; Ni 79 mg/g; Ga 24 μg/g; Ge ~80 μg/g; As 29 μg/g; Ir 0.50 μg/g; Au 2.39 μg/g. Data are the mean of duplicate determinations. The composition of the metal differs in detail from other pallasites. For example, the Ir concentration is 0.50 ug/g, with the nearest relative Seymchan at 0.67 μg/g and Barcis at 0.32 μg/g.
Classification: On element-Au diagrams, Conception Junction plots distinctly lower than most PMG on Ni and Cu and above most PMG on Co, Ga, As, and Ir diagrams; it is therefore classified as PMG-anomalous (PMG-an). Its Ni and Cu contents are the lowest known for PMG. Its nearest PMG-an neighbor on most diagrams is Krasnojarsk. The low Ni and high Co could reflect unrepresentative sampling of kamacite and taenite but these are the means of two replicates.Specimens: 113.58 g type specimen, UCLA.  Main mass, Karl Aston, Dave Gheesling and Robert Ward

Classification: Ordinary chondrite (H5)
History: Found on a slightly vegetated dune not far from the beach during a holiday walk.
Physical characteristics: Dark brown, wind-ablated stone lacking fusion crust. Some fractures contain sand grains and efflorescence of halite.
Petrography: Well defined chondrules.  Feldspar grain size rarely up to 50 μm. Opaque phases are metal, troilite (polycrystalline), chromite, ilmenite, graphite (inclusion in metal). The analyzed thin section contains a single chromite-plagioclase-chondrule (0.3 mm). Metal is largely altered to maghemite-magnetite and hydroxides, troilite shows only minor alteration.
Geochemistry: Olivine has mean composition of Fa18.7, pyroxene Fs16.2Wo1.3.

Oklahoma, USAFound: 1994
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (H5)
History: Found by Mr. Kenton Gossen in 1994, in a pasture 2 miles north and 2 miles east of Corn, Washita Co., Oklahoma. Mr. Gossen took the specimen to Southwest State College and was told it was not a meteorite, but he kept it on the shelf in his office until meeting Ms. Sandra Cloud, a science teacher at Corn Bible Academy.  In March 2011, Ms. Cloud brought the meteorite to the Kansas Meteorite Museum and Nature Center in Haviland, where the curator (Dr. Donald Stimpson) identified it as an ordinary chondrite and arranged to purchase it.
Physical characteristics: A single, large brownish stone weighing 5176 g.
Petrography: (A. Irving and S. Kuehner, UWS) The specimen is somewhat recrystallized but some chondrules remain.  Primary minerals are olivine, orthopyroxene, sodic plagioclase, chromite, troilite and some kamacite (partially altered to iron hydroxides).
Geochemistry: Olivine (Fa17.9-18.3), orthopyroxene (Fs16.0-16.6Wo1.2), clinopyroxene (Fs5.8Wo45.8-46.1).
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (H5, S2, W2).
Specimens: A total of 21 g of sample and one polished thin section are on deposit at UWS.  The main mass was purchased by DStimpson for the Kansas Meteorite Museum.

Cordoba, ArgentinaFound: 10 May 1971
Classification: Iron meteorite (IAB complex)
History: A single metallic mass of 14.0 kg was found outside the town of Cruz del Eje by an anonymous person. A sample of this metal including both interior and exterior portions was sent to Cascadia in March, 2008 for examination.
Physical characteristics: (A. Ruzicka, Cascadia): The exterior surface has a brown to black weathering patina. The interior is relatively featureless except for  irregular cracks at grain boundaries, along which minor weathering has occurred.
Petrography: (S. Kissin, LHU; A. Ruzicka, Cascadia): Microscopic examination of cut and etched surfaces show that the meteorite is a coarsest octahedrite, containing taenite but dominated by irregularly shaped kamacite grains with bandwidth >3.3 mm.  Microhardness measurements for kamacite yielded VHN = 201 mean (range 196-206, 3 measurements).  This indicates moderate work hardening.
Geochemistry: (S. Kissin, LHU; A. Ruzicka, Cascadia): INAA was performed according to the methods of Wasson et al. (1998) at Activation Laboratories (Ancaster, Ontario), irradiating polished cubes of ~0.4 g and ~3.2 mm thick. This yielded the following elemental concentrations (all units μg/g except where noted): As (12.8), Au (1.52), Co (4.62 mg/g), Cr (21), Cu (108), Ga (44), Ge (130), Ir (4.21), Ni (68.9 mg/g), Pt (11.6), Re (0.38), Sb (<20), W (<10).  These data suggest that the meteorite belongs to the IAB complex as defined by Wasson and Kallemeyn (2002).  Most elemental concentrations are similar to those reported for the IAB main group, except that the concentration of Ga is lower by ~50% and that of Ge is lower by ~60%.  However, the determinations of Ga and Ge may be somewhat in error.
Classification: Iron, coarsest octahedrite (IAB)
Specimens: A type specimen of 21.4 g is available at Cascadia. The main mass is held by the finder.

Stone. Ordinary chondrite (H6)
A single mass of 30 g with weathered surface and no fusion
crust was found by archaeologists excavating a site occupied from 800 B.C. to
50 B.C., located on a hill 9 km SSW of Andover. The Iron Age occupants had dug
thousands of pits on the site. Many pits are about 1.5 m in depth and diameter
and the meteorite came from the fill about halfway down one of them. Routine
work in 1989 revealed that the stone has mafic minerals and Ni-bearing metal,
which Chris Salter (Oxford University, Departments of Archaeology and Materials
Science) interpreted as meteoritic. Classification, analysis, olivine Fa18;
merrilite present; R. Hutchison, The Natural History Museum, London SW7 5BD, UK. This is the first British meteorite `find.' Main mass and thin section at Oxford University.

Macroscopic Description: Tim McCoy
These two masses each exhibit a highly corroded and discolored surface, where they were in contact with the soil on Derrick Peak, and a shiny brown surface. The upper surface is highly pitted. The larger of the two masses exhibits prominent linear protrusions of resistant schreibersite crystals in depressions formed by severe terrestrial weathering and removal of the original surface. These depressions are aligned, probably reflecting alignment of the resistant schreibersite.


Microscopic Description: Tim McCoy

On a cut surface, these are typical members of the Derrick Peak iron shower (Clarke, Meteoritics 17, 129). Only a thin layer of corrosion is found on the surface and neither fusion crust nor heat-altered zone is found. Structurally, they are coarsest octahedrites with large areas of swathing kamacite enclosing elongate, skeletal schreibersite crystals and cm-sized round troilite inclusions. Like other Derrick Peak irons, they are certainly members of group IIAB.

Iron, ataxite
(ungrouped)
A 40 kg iron was found by Oleg
Gus’kov, Moscow resident, as he was returning home from collecting mushrooms
near the village of Dronino in the Ryazan district. In early 2003, it was taken
to Vernad, and identified as meteoritic. In summer 2003, scientific
expeditions and meteorite hunters collected more than 600 fragments (the
largest is 250 kg) totaling about 3 000 kg and occurring at a depth of 0.2-2 m
across an area of 0.5x1.5 km. The distribution of the fragments suggests that
the meteorite formed a now-buried crater about 30 m in diameter. This crater is
not reflected in the present-day topography of the site. No historical records
exist of a meteorite fall, thus it appears likely that the meteorite fell
earlier than the 12th century when the area was largely unpopulated.
Classification and mineralogy (D. Badyukov, M. Nazarov, Vernad; J.
Wasson, UCLA): the Dronino iron is an ataxite containing sulfide
inclusions (~10 vol.%) and consisting of kamacite (7.0±0.5 wt% Ni and 0.75 wt% Co) and rare taenite (26.5±0.5 wt% Ni and 0.35 wt% Co) as elongated
precipitates (1-3 μm in size) which form linear and banded textures;
sulfide inclusions (up to a few mm in size) rounded and elongated along the
banding; accessories are chromite and Fe phosphate (graftonite?); no phosphide
was found and P is not detectable in metal with EMP; INAA data: Ni 98.1, Co
5.54 (mg/g), Cr 37, Cu 32, Ga <0.3, As 3.52, W 0.38, Ir 1.68 ppm, Au 0.284
(μg/g); the meteorite is most close to IVA irons in Ni, Ir and the low P
but the low Au and Ga contents distinguish the Dronino element pattern from
that of all known iron meteorite groups. Dronino meteorite fragments are
heavily weathered and covered with rust 1-3 cm thick. Sulfide nodules are
surrounded by Fe hydroxides, which replace metal. Troilite of the nodules is
commonly replaced with unknown Fe,Ni sulfides. Specimens: type specimen 700 kg
including the largest 250 kg piece Vernad.

In 1997 January, an unknown
mass of material, possibly broken apart from a single large stone, was sold to
meteorite collectors by nomads near the town of Mhamid, Morocco; this material
has since been resold under the names Mhamid and Hamada du Draa.  The
nomads claimed that this meteorite was found to the south, in Algeria (~29º50'N
5º50'W), in the direction of a fireball seen in 1995 January.  In 1997 September,
the same nomads shipped a fragment of a meteorite that they claimed was seen to
fall on 1997 August 10 to Mr. Edwin Thompson.  In 1997 November, Thompson traveled
to Mauritania and collected six
fresh-looking stones totaling ~200 kg (individual masses of 80, 51, 30,
26, 8, and 4 kg) at the base of the El Hammami Mountains in Mauritania (1000 km
southwest of Mhamid, Morocco), probably in the place where they fell; fragments
of these have been sold by Thompson and other dealers under the name El
Hammami.  Classification and mineralogy of El Hammami stones (A. Rubin, UCLA):
olivine, Fa18.8; pyroxene Fs16.7Wo1.4;
shock stage S2; contains metal veins; petrologic type 5.  Classification and mineralogy
of Hamada du Draa stones (D. Weber, Mün):  olivine, Fa19.2;
pyroxene Fs17.4; shock stage S2; contains conspicuous metal-rich
veins; petrologic type 5/6; some of the material appears weathered and rusts
easily, but the bulk is quite fresh.  Specimens from El Hammami stones:
~100 kg, Thompson; type specimen, UCLA.  Specimens originally
called Hamada du Draa are now scattered in private collections, and some
may remain in Morocco; type specimen, ~1 kg, Mün.  
Because all of the
above-described material seems likely to represent a single fall, the name El
Hammami shall be the official collective name.  Mhamid and Hamada
du Draa should be considered only as unofficial synonyms for El Hammami.
The total known mass of material is probably ~240 kg.

Petrographic Description: Brian Mason
The section shows a microbreccia of angular fragments (grains
up to 2 mm across) of pyroxene (orthopyroxene and pigeonite) and plagioclase,
in a matrix of comminuted pyroxene and plagioclase. Trace amounts of
troilite and nickel-iron are present, and rare plagioclase-pigeonite clasts, up
to 1.5 mm across. Microprobe analyses show a wide range in pyroxene
compositions: Wo1-24, En33-77, Fs22-53; the grains with En >70 indicate the presence
of a diogenitic component. Plagioclase shows a considerable range of
compositions, An7-21. The meteorite is classed as a howardite and is possibly
paired with EETA79006.

Classification: Iron meteorite (IAB, ungrouped)
History: The specimen was purchased by an anonymous collector in August 2010 at an estate sale in Elizabeth, Illinois, with an assortment of other unrelated artifacts.  The deceased original owner reportedly found it on his local farm in the 1950s.
Physical characteristics: An irregular mass (732 g) with brown weathering patina on most surfaces, except where some hacksaw cuts had been made to reveal the silvery metallic interior.  Acid-etched interior surfaces exhibit an oriented intergrowth texture of silver metal and black cohenite-rich regions.
Petrography: A. Irving and S. Kuehner, UWS) Predominantly kamacite with accessory schreibersite and taenite (as ""wispy"" grains), plus fairly abundant elongate ovoid regions (up to 3 mm long by 1 mm wide) composed of cohenite + low-Ni kamacite + minor low-Ni taenite, which show preferred alignment in several directions.  No Widmanstätten pattern was revealed with an iron chloride etch, but the cohenite-rich regions show distinctly as black, partly porous objects.
Geochemistry: Trace elements (G. Chen and C. Herd, UAb) Analysis of a 4 gram portion by ICP-MS using North Chile as internal standard gave: Ni=76.0, Co=5.2 (both mg/g); Cr=13, Cu=170, Ga=93.5, Ge=335, As=6.2, Ir=2.1, Pt=6.4, Au=1.44 (μg/g), Sb =370, Re=200 (both ng/g).
Classification: Iron meteorite (IAB, ungrouped). Chemical data comparisons for possible matches to regional and other common irons were inconclusive.
Specimens: A total of 31.5 g of material is reposited with PSF. The remaining mass remains with the present owner.

Ordinary chondrite (H4) 
History: The meteorite was recognized by Smail Mostefaoui in his hometown El-Oued at the regional Museum ""Le petit Musée du Monde."" The present director of the Museum, Mr. Ahmed Chaouki Bouclifa, explained that the meteorite was discovered in 1952 by the French army during their patrol in Zemoul el Merkr dunes Southeast of the El-Oued city. 
Physical characteristics: The total mass = 2.305 kg in two pieces (1.485 and 0.820 kg). The fusion crust in both fragments is incomplete and has little rust and brownish color. The interior is darker. 
Petrography (M. Bourot-Denise, MNHNP): The chondritic texture is clearly visible. The metal is almost completely altered. The silicates show cracks filled with Fe-hydroxide. Some melt pockets are present; one thin section is crossed with a cm-sized vein of polycrystalline sulfide. Some olivine grains contain sulfide-filled cracks. 
Mineral compositions and geochemistry: Olivine: mean Fa = 20.1 ± 0.8; low-Ca pyroxene: mean Fs = 17.3 ± 0.6. The magnetic susceptibility value (log χ = 4.61) measured by J. Gattacceca (CEREGE) is consistent with a high weathering degree. 
Classification: Ordinary chondrite H4; W3/W4; S3. 
Type specimens: A total of 30 g (2 pieces and two thin sections) is on deposit at MNHN. The Museum in El-Oued holds the main mass. "

Classification: Ordinary chondrite (L6)
History: A single stone of 87.2 g was found south-east of Medenine near the small village of  Neffatia (Naffatiyah) by an anonymous finder, who is Tunisian, and holds the main mass.
Petrography: (A. Bischoff, IfP). The hand specimen is very brown resulting from severe weathering in the desert.   In thin section, the texture of En Naffatiyah is highly recrystallized and only a few relic chondrules are visible. This indicates a high metamorphic grade as does the homogeneous composition of olivine and pyroxene. Based on the mean olivine and low-Ca pyroxene compositions of Fa25.5 and Fs21, respectively, the rock is classified as an L-group ordinary chondrite. Based on the classification scheme of Stöffler et al. (1991) the rock is moderately shocked (S4) as indicated by mosaicism in olivine and the transformation of some plagioclase into maskelynite. Shock veins go throughout the sample. The weathering effects are inhomogeneous within the sample (W2-3).
Classification: En Naffatiyah is an L6, S4, W2-3, ordinary chondrite.
Specimens: A mass of 19 g and one thin section are on deposit at IfP. An anonymous collector holds the main mass.

Custer County, South Dakota, USAFound: 1907
Classification: Iron meteorite (IAB, ungrouped)
History: Found in 1907 by Otis Roberts in a railroad car transporting gravel for ballast quarried from terrace deposits of Pleistocene age on the west side of the Cheyenne River in Custer County, southeast of Rapid City, South Dakota (Ziegler, 1914, p. 54-58).  The original 445 g mass described by Victor Ziegler was in the collection of the South Dakota School of Mines.  In 1982 a 56 g portion was purchased by James M. DuPont, on which studies were conducted from 2004 to 2012.
Physical characteristics: A smooth, rounded ovoid silvery mass (445 g) with thin weathering patina and a specific gravity of 7.306.
Petrography: (G. Jerman, MSFC) The specimen is composed mostly of kamacite with some taenite and plessite.  Some globular and ribbon-like schreibersite is present, but no silicates, sulfides or carbides were found. Kamacite bandwidth 1.34 mm (range 0.37-1.96, n=18).
Geochemistry: Trace elements (G. Chen and C. Herd, UAb) Analysis of a 3.1 g portion by ICP-MS using North Chile as internal standard gave: Ni=78.8, Co=5.3 (both mg/g); Cr=17, Cu=132, Ga=76.5, Ge=255, As=6.1, Ir=2.3; Pt=5.2, Au=1.49 (all μg/g), Sb=420, Re=220 (both ng/g).
Classification: Iron meteorite (IAB, ungrouped). Chemical data comparisons for possible matches to regional and other common irons were inconclusive.
Specimens: A total of 52 g is on deposit as part of the DuPont Collection owned by PSF.

Oregon, United StatesFound: Spring 1974
Classification: Iron meteorite (IIIF)
History: A metallic mass was found by Mr. Paul Albertson at Fitzwater Pass, Oregon. The find location is a grassy area with scattered trees along a mountaintop ~5 km north of the Oregon-California border. One corner of the sample was ground off many years ago by Mr. Albertson, removing perhaps ~2-3 g of material, to reveal a shiny metallic interior.  This left a mass of 65.4 g available for study.
Physical characteristics: (A. Ruzicka, Cascadia): The specimen is a small (~4 x 2 x 2 cm) iron meteorite that has a rough, blocky and lineated surface texture, which appears to reflect the internal Widmanstatten structure. It is almost completely covered with a dark brown to black weathering patina.
Petrography: (S. Kissin, LHU; A. Ruzicka, Cascadia):  Microscopic examination of cut and etched surfaces show that the meteorite is a coarse octahedrite with bandwidth 1.44 ± 0.29 mm (mean and standard deviation, n = 6 measurements), and kamacite L:W = 3:1 (all widths corrected according to the procedure of Frost, 1965).  Microhardness measurements yielded VHN = 202 mean (range 199-203, n = 3) for kamacite, and VHN = 299 mean (range 254-358, n = 3) for taenite.  This indicates moderate work hardening.  An exterior weathering rind of ~0.5-1 mm thickness containing iron oxide/hydroxide minerals is locally present. Minor sulfide is present.
Geochemistry: (S. Kissin, LHU; A. Ruzicka, Cascadia): INAA was performed according to the methods of Wasson et al. (1998) at Activation Laboratories (Ancaster, Ontario), irradiating polished cubes of ~0.4 g and ~3.2 mm thick. This yielded the following elemental concentrations (all units µg/g except where noted): As (17.9), Au (1.8), Co (5.06 mg/g), Cr (34), Cu (180), Ga (10), Ge (<10), Ir (2.54), Ni (80.7 mg/g), Pt (9.2), Re (0.23), Sb (<20), W (<10).  These data suggest a designation of Group IIIF, an uncommon type (with <10 individuals known), although Ga is high compared to other IIIF irons by ~30%, probably owing to analytical error.  This is the same group designation as for Klamath Falls, which was found ~78 km to the northwest, raising the possibility that both could have been in the same strewn field.  However, the two meteorites are probably not paired, as Klamath Falls has a smaller kamacite bandwidth (0.5 mm), and concentrations for Ir, Pt, and Re that are ~0.002x, ~0.12x, and ~2.8x the values in the new iron.
Classification: Iron, coarse octahedrite (IIIF)
Specimens: A type specimen of 12.4 g is available at Cascadia. The main mass (45.7 g) is held by the finder.

Find: 2000
Pallasite (main group)
History: An anonymous finder recovered a 1003 kg
specimen near Fukang, China, in 2000. The sample was at the Tucson Gem and
Mineral Show in February 2005, and seen by D. S. Lauretta of UAz.
Approximately 20 kg had been removed from the main mass by the finder before
the Tuscon show and the mass investigated at UAz was 983 kg. (D. S.
Lauretta, D. Hill, M. Killgore, D. Della-Giustina, Y. Goreva, UAz; I. Franchi, OpenU).
Petrography and Geochemistry: Olivine: Throughout the
large mass, olivines vary in shape from rounded to angular; many are fractured.
They range in size from <5 mm to several cm. The main pallasite contains
several regions of “massive” olivine clusters up to 11 cm in diameter with thin
metal veins only a few millimeters in width. Fo86.4 with molar Fe/Mg
= 0.1367, Fe/Mn = 40.37, and Ni = 0.03 wt%. Zoning was not observed for Al, Cr,
Ca, Mn, or Fe typical of olivines in main-group pallasites. Metal and sulfides:
Groundmass is mostly kamacite with some occurrences of kamacite mantles
surrounding taenite cores, rounded taenite adjacent to kamacite, and regions of
“comb plessite. ” Kamacite contains an average Ni = 6.98 wt%. Schreibersite is
enclosed by wide kamacite bands and as mantles adjacent to olivines. Two
populations of schreibersite are present with Ni = 26 and 35 wt% near chromite.
Vermicular sulfide (troilite) is present in some olivine. Thin veins of
kamacite and troilite occur inside many olivines as well. Minor phases:
Euhedral chromites up to 0.5 cm, rounded whitlockite adjacent to olivine, and
troilite heterogeneously distributed in thin veins. Several regions, ranging
from <100 µm to several millimeters, that contain a complex mixture of
olivine, low-Ca pyroxene, troilite, and whitlockite were observed adjacent to
chromite. Bulk composition: Fe = 89.9 ± 0.3, Ni = 9.0 ± 0.2, P = 0.62 ± 0.02,
Co = 0.51 ± 0.01 (all wt%); Ge = 41 ± 4, As = 26 ± 5, Ga = 19.1 ± 0.5, Pd = 5.1
± 0.2, Au = 2.6 ± 0.2, (all µg/g); Ir = 43 ± 4 ng/g. Oxygen isotopes: δ18O
= 2.569, δ17O = 1.179, ∆1 7O = −0.157 (all ‰).
Classification: Pallasite (main group).
Specimens: A total of 31 kg of type specimen is on
deposit at UAz. M. Killgore holds a total of 31 kg. An anonymous
collector holds the main mass.

Two stony fragments of 314.5 and 29.5 g, fitting together, were recognised by E. Twelker while examining a parcel of meteorites purchased from Burkina-Faso which, according to the vendor, were found in the Gao-Guenie strewn-field. Mineralogy and classification (A. N. Krot, UH): Abundant large, metal-rich porphyritic olivine, olivine-pyroxene and pyroxene type I chondrules (Fa 3.1±1.7, n = 20; Fs2.7±1.3, n = 18); many chondrules are layered and surrounded by silica-rich igneous rims (Krot et al., 2003). Type II chondrules and chondrules of non-porphyritic textures are rare. Anorthite-rich chondrules (Krot and Keil, 2002) are rather common. Refractory inclusions are rare and include amoeboid olivine aggregates (Fa0.6±0.6, n = 36), and melilite-rich CAIs; melilite is commonly replaced by anorthite.

East Uweinat Desert, EgyptFound: 19 February 2009
Classification: Iron meteorite (ungrouped)
History: A total of about 1600 kg of iron meteorite shrapnel (thousands of pieces), ranging in mass from < 1 to 35,000 g, plus a single 83 kg individual completely covered with well developed regmaglypts, was found in and around the 45 m diameter Kamil impact crater by an Italian-Egyptian geophysical team in February 2009 and February 2010. Approximately 800 kg of the total mass observed in the field (the regmaglypted individual inclusive) was recovered. The Kamil crater was identified by V. De Michele, former curator of the Natural History Museum in Milan, Italy. The geophysical survey was carried out within the framework of the ""2009 Italian-Egyptian Year of Science and Technology"".
Physical characteristics: A 634 g type specimen, measuring 88 × 70 × 55 mm, is flattened and jagged shrapnel with a rough, dark-brown external surface. The surface originally sitting in the desert soil shows some oxy-hydroxides due to terrestrial weathering.
Petrography: (M. D’Orazio, DST-PI; Luigi Folco, MNA-SI) Etched sections show an ataxitic structure interrupted on a cm-scale by crystals of schreibersite, troilite and daubreelite enveloped in swathing kamacite. Kamacite spindles (20 ± 5 μm wide) nucleated on tiny schreibersite crystals. The spindles form small aligned clusters and are rimmed by taenite. The matrix is a duplex plessite made of approximately the same proportion of kamacite and taenite lamellae (1-5 μm in thickness) arranged in a micro-Widmanstätten pattern. Many sections show, particularly close to the external surface,  shear dislocations offsetting the plessitic matrix and the crystals of the accessory phases by several millimeters.
Geochemistry: Composition of the metal (ICP-MS; D’Orazio and Folco, 2003) is Co = 0.75, Ni = 19.8 (both in wt%), Cu = 464, Ga = 49, Ge = 121, As = 15.6, Mo = 9.1, Ru = 2.11, Rh = 0.75, Pd = 4.8, Sn = 2.49, Sb = 0.26, W = 0.66, Re = 0.04, Ir = 0.39, Pt = 3.5, Au = 1.57 (all in ppm). 
Classification: (M. D’Orazio, DST-PI; Luigi Folco, MNA-SI) Iron meteorite (ungrouped), Ni-rich ataxite, extensive shear deformation and low weathering.
Specimens: Type specimens of approximately 15 kg and one section at MNA-SI; approximately 5 kg at DST-PI. Main mass of the recovered specimens at Egyptian Geological Museum (Mineral Resources Authority), Cairo, Egypt.Reference: D’Orazio M. and Folco L. (2003) Chemical analysis of iron

This meteorite was analyzed by Choi et al. (1995) and subsequently listed in the Catalogue of meteorites (Grady 2000) as an anomalous IIICD iron with silicate inclusions. It was later analyzed by Wasson and Kallemeyn (2002), who classified it as a “solo iron related to IAB.” The name “Georgetown (iron)” is now recognized as official by the Meteorite Nomenclature Committee. J. T. Wasson (personal communication 2007) reports that Georgetown (iron) was found an unknown distance from Georgetown, Queensland, Australia, by a gold prospector with a metal detector. A 1.3 kg specimen was received by Robert Haag in 1991. UCLA now holds pieces weighing 645 g (possibly part of the Haag piece), 420 g, and 461 g. "

Arnhem Land, Northern Territory, AustraliaFound: 24 February 1979
Classification: Relict meteorite (Relict iron)
History: A deeply oxidized mass of ""fossil"" iron meteorite was excavated from bauxite at an open cut mine on the Gove Peninsula.
Physical characteristics: The original mass is reported to have measured 0.75 to 1 m in diameter and is of unknown weight. On removal from the bauxite, the meteorite was described as being encased in a sheath of iron oxides.
Petrography: The meteorite is almost completely altered to oxides and oxyhydroxides of iron and nickel. Polished sections of competent fragments retain a relict Widmanstätten pattern (approximate bandwidth 0.5 mm) preserved in iron oxides. In the microstructure there are vestiges of former structures (plessite fields) now preserved in iron oxides, and small relict grains of primary minerals such as taenite (27 wt% Ni) and daubreélite. Secondary minerals as the result of weathering include awaruite.
Geochemistry: An analysis at the mine site laboratory by company chemist D. H. Har­per gave 8.5 wt% Ni.  Modern analysis (J.T. Wasson UCLA; INAA, single analysis) of oxidized material gave Ni = 32.9, Co = 3.67 (both mg/g), Cr = 168, Cu = 195, Ga = 22.5, Ge = <70, As = 4.16, W = 1.35, Ir = 10.5, Pt = 21.2, Au = 0.672 (all μg/g), Sb = <150, Re = 844 (both ng/g).
Classification: Iron (chemical group unknown, fine octahedrite; possibly group IVA or IIIAB).
Specimens: Main mass (immersed in kerosene) at Geoscience Australia, Canberra. Fragment measuring 23x15x10 cm at the Alcan Gove Pty mine site, Northern Territory. 1164.8 g of fragments at WAM. 590 g of fragments at the Northern Territory Museum, Darwin. Analyzed sample at UCLA.

Hambleton, North Yorkshire,
England, United Kingdom 
Find: August 2005
Pallasite (main group)
History: A mass was found beside a forest track by R.
and I. Elliott while they were hunting for meteorites, ~2 km south of
Hambleton, North Yorkshire, England.
Physical characteristics: One 17.6 kg piece was
found. It has a highly weathered exterior with centimeter-size patches of blue
weathering products. No fusion crust is present. 
Petrography and mineral compositions: (D. Johnson and
M. M. Grady, OU; R. Hutchison and C. Kirk, NHM) The meteorite is
brittle and easily fragments. It contains ~60 vol% olivine (Fo88.3), ~25 vol%
metal, and ~15 vol% sulfide (all irregularly distributed). Olivine ranges in
size from ~10 mm in fractured, rounded grains that form mosaics in olivine-rich
regions, to angular fragments <0.1 mm set in metal or sulfide where these
opaques are dominant. The olivine mosaics have metal and/or sulfide veins along
grain boundaries or filling fractures. Metal is largely kamacite, commonly as
plessitic intergrowths with taenite, which also forms thin rims with Ni <60
wt%. Sulfides are abnormally abundant for a pallasite and some regions (<5
cm across) are composed almost exclusively of troilite, enclosing minor
fragmented olivines. Within olivine and metal, sulfides occur as veins,
commonly with Ni-poor centers and Ni-rich rims. Chromite and schreibersite are
accessory phases. The outer 1 cm of the mass is terrestrially weathered, with
veins of Fe-oxides and patches of a blue phosphate mineral.
Geochemistry: Oxygen isotopic: (I. A. Franchi, PSSRI,
OU) δ17O = +1.383, δ18O = +3.029, Δ17O
= −0.187 (all ‰). Classification: Pallasite (main group).
Type specimen: A 1 kg type specimen, 3 slices, and 1
thin section are on deposit at OU. R. Elliott of Fernlea holds
the main mass."

Castro County, Texas, USAFound: 2010 March
Classification: Carbonaceous chondrite (CK3)
History: In March 2010, a field worker found a dense stone beside a road located 0.25 mile from the town of Hart.  The specimen was purchased by Jason Phillips in July 2012.
Physical characteristics: A single, large brownish stone weighing 966 g.
Petrography: (A. Irving and S. Kuehner, UWS) Separated, medium-sized chondrules and rare, small CAIs occur within a fairly altered, deep reddish-brown matrix.  Discrete grains of Cr-magnetite are present in PO chondrules.  One CAI (diameter 150 μm) is composed of gehlenite + spinel + perovskite with a rim containing andradite garnet; a separate large grain of gehlenite was found.  The matrix contains Cr-magnetite and minor Ni-poor kamacite (some grains rimmed by magnetite), as well as secondary iron hydoxides.  Most olivine and pyroxene are very magnesian, but more ferroan grains are present in the matrix.
Geochemistry: Olivine (Fa0.9-50.2; Cr2O3 = 0.19-0.21 wt.%), orthopyroxene (Fs0.8-16.2Wo0.8-1.2), magnesian pigeonite (Fs0.9Wo20.7), subcalcic diopside (Fs2.1Wo34.8), diopside (Fs0.6Wo44.9), Al-Ti-rich diopside (Fs0.4Wo55.1; TiO2 = 1.2 wt.%, Al2O3 = 9.6 wt.%).
Classification: Carbonaceous chondrite (CK3, S2, W2/3).
Specimens: A total of 20.96 g of sample and one polished thin section are on deposit at UWB.  The main mass is held by Mr. J. Phillips.

Classification: Ordinary chondrite (L5)
History: A solitary piece was found lying on the stony surface of the Nullarbor Plain by K.L. Bell.
Physical characteristics: The sub-rounded, pyramidal-shaped stone weighs 40.9 g and measures 3.5 cm on the longest axis. The exterior is dark reddish brown, with the exception of darker, remnant fusion crust (~10%) and several paler colored macro-chondrules, up to 5 mm. The interior is dark brown to black and shows chondrules and metallic specks.
Petrography: (Kim Lai N. Bell, Monash). Chondrules and chondrule fragments lie within a fine-grained recrystallized matrix cross cut by dark μm to mm thick veins. Mineralogy consists of olivine, pyroxene, plagioclase, sulfides, Fe-Ni metal and minor ringwoodite, maskylenite and chromite.  Olivine displays undulose to mosaic extinction, and larger grains contain PDFs.  Pyroxene grains also exhibit similar textures. Plagioclase generally >50 μm, with some grains replaced by maskylenite.  Troilite (~10%) and Fe-Ni metal (3%) occur as irregularly shaped grains, with up to 35% replaced by oxides. Chondrules 0.3 to 5 mm, mean ~0.6 mm, with some more readily discernable than others due to recrystallization. Textural types include BO, POP, GOP, PP, RP, PO, and PP. An Al-rich chondrule containing maskylenite, olivine and very fine-grained chromite was observed.
Geochemistry: EMPA (wt%) Olivine: SiO2 = 37.55, TiO2 = 0.01, Al2O3 = 0.03, FeO = 23.32, MnO = 0.47, MgO = 38.52, CaO = 0.02, Na2O = 0.01, K2O = 0.01, (Fa = 25.35 mol%, σ = 0.79, n = 11). Low-Ca pyroxene: SiO2 = 54.24, TiO2 = 0.18, Al2O3 = 0.27, FeO = 14.37, MnO = 0.45, MgO = 28.59, CaO = 0.64, Na2O = 0.03, K2O = 0.01, (Fs = 21.72 mol%, σ = 0.73, n = 2). Plagioclase: SiO2 = 71.14, TiO2 = 0.05, Al2O3 = 22.94, FeO = 0.24, MnO = 0.01, MgO = 0.01, CaO = 2.30, Na2O = 2.60, K2O = 1.08 (An = 28.95, σ=1.84, n = 5). Kamacite: Ni = 6.39, Co = 0.89. Troilite: Fe = 62.96, Ni = 0.10. Pentlandite: Ni = 8.49, Co = 0.34.

History: U. Messerli of Hermringen, Switzerland, found this single stone in the Ilizi area of Algeria in 1991. The sample was submitted to NMBE for classification in 2003. The stone was found among many terrestrial rocks. The terrestrial rocks show evidence that early humans may have used them as tools. It is suspected that the meteorite, due to one surface being very flat and smooth, may also have been used a tool during the Neolithic.
Physical characteristics: Dark brown rounded stone without fusion crust, 5.5 × 5 × 4 cm in size, 185 g mass. One side displays a very flat and smooth surface (~4 × 4 cm). The interior shows chondrules up to 5 mm in diameter.
Petrography: (E. Gnos, UBE; B. Hofmann, NMBE) Average olivine (Fa18.6), average orthopyroxene (Fs17.5Wo1.25). Classification: Ordinary chondrite (H4); S2, W4.
Type specimen: A 21.5 g type specimen and 1 polished thin section are on deposit at NMBE. U. Messerli holds the main mass"

Physical Description: Roy S Clarke, Jr.
This specimen was found near Inland Forts by Bob Ackert of
the University of Maine at Orono, it was found ""imbedded in loose sandy
till with abundant pebbles and cobbles of the Beacon Sandstone and dolorite.
The glacial deposit overlies the Beacon Sandstone. The top of the white
evaporite deposit marks the depth at which the iron was buried."" The
specimen is flat with an outline similar to a policeman's badge, 13.5 cm x 12
cm x 4 cm. It has three distinct surface types. The exposed surface as found is
slightly irregular and covered with a scaly reddish-brown to dark reddish-brown
iron oxide coating. This surface is bordered on the sides by a band of cream
colored soil and clay a few mms to a cm or slightly more thick. The sides and
bottom of the specimen below this band have a much different appearance. The
surface is rough, ranges in color from black to reddish-brown, and has numerous
soil particles and sand grains adhering.
 
Tentative Classification: Roy S. Clarke, Jr.
A metallographic surface of 9 cm2 was prepared
for examination. The most prominent feature of the martensitic matrix surface
are cm-long lamellar inclusions that appear to be oriented according to parent
taenite crystallography. They are bordered by thin kamacite that occasionally
contains schreibersite. They appear to have contained very thin cores that have
been replaced by oxides due to weathering. The matrix contains a high concentration
of schreibersites in the 50 micron range surrounded by kamacite. The
orientation of the kamacite seems to have been controlled by schreibersite
precipitation. One small troilite was seen. The specimen is similar in many
ways to the meteorite Freda.

Tirol, AustriaFound: 1976 June
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (LL6)
History: A single black stone was found by Josef Pfefferle on a mountain road near the town of Ischgl, Austria, in June 1976, while he was clearing the remnants of a snow avalanche. According to the finder, the stone had apparently fallen out of the snow and was lying in the middle of the road. He recognized the unusual appearance of the rock and suspected that it might be a meteorite. However, it was not until 2008 that he brought the stone to the University of Innsbruck where its meteoritic nature was confirmed. In 2011, the meteorite was purchased from the finder by the NHMV.
Physical characteristics: Single 710 g grayish-black, fresh fusion crusted stone with some well-defined regmaglypts. A broken face (~8 × 5 cm) exhibits a light-gray breccia with few metallic grains.
Petrography: (J. Konzett, UInns; F. Brandstätter, NHMV). Thin section shows a strongly recrystallized matrix with a few indistinct chondrules. Plagoiclase (50-100 μm in size) shows polysynthetic twinning.

History and physical characteristics: With a loud noise a meteorite fell close to a sheperd on a small hill in Huang Hua Shan Xiang near Jarud Qi (also known as Zhalute Qi and Lubei), while he was feeding sheep. Later he reported to the villagers that many stones totaling 100 kg fell, one of them killed a sheep. About one year later, an antique dealer took three of these stones to his home. In 2006 one of the stones was obtained by R. Bartoschewitz. This stone is a 452 g fragment, about 50% is covered with black fusion crust. There is no further information concerning the remnant pieces and the main mass. Magnetic susceptibility (Bart.): log χ = 4.87 x 10-9 m3/kg.
Petrography (R. Bartoschewitz, Bart): Well recognizable chondrules up to 2 mm are embedded in fine-grained recrystallized matrix with metal up to 1.5 mm, and a 1 mm wide melt vein.

Javorje, Poljane Valley, SloveniaFound: 5 Nov 2009
Classification: Iron meteorite (IIIAB)
History: A 4.92 kg rusty iron mass was found on 5 November 2009 by Mr. Vladimir Štibelj while building a forest road on a steep slope in the woods near the village of Javorje above the Poljane Valley, Slovenia. The sample was buried in weathered Carboniferous quartz sandstones and marlstones at a depth of ~70 cm. Mr. Štibelj informed a geologist Mr. Pavel A. Forjanèiè, who brought the piece to GeoZS. SEM/EDS analysis confirmed it was an iron meteorite. An 11 g slice was sent to ActLab for chemical analysis.
Physical characteristics: The meteorite is roughly triangular shaped, with an original mass of 4920 g and dimensions 15 × 12.5 × 11 cm. The exterior is partially covered with a thick dark brown and yellow to red-brown crust of secondary iron oxides. A small piece of limonitized host-rock was cemented to the meteorite surface by weathering products. Where crust of weathered material is missing, surface textures of the meteorite clearly indicate octahedral cleavage.
Petrography: (M. Miler, M. Gosar, GeoZS) Distinct Widmanstätten pattern with an average band width of 0.99 ± 0.3 mm (n = 50). Some kamacite bands exhibit Neumann lines in two different directions. Spaces between kamacite bands are filled by large comb, net, and cellular plessite. Taenite occurs in the form of very thin exsolution lamellae along the boundaries between kamacite bands and as an abundant phase in plessite. Phosphides occur as scarce massive and border schreibersites and numerous rhabdites. Long prismatic and acicular rhabdite crystals, which are perpendicular to each other, form net-like inclusions in kamacite bands. Troilite occurs as relatively large elongated inclusions within kamacite grains and as individual grains at the kamacite/kamacite interfaces. Troilite is  associated with rare chromite. Daubreélite forms exsolution lamellae in the troilite. Minute euhedral precipitates of carlsbergite form thin rims around some daubreélite grains. The external surface shows iron hydroxides. Terrestrial weathering has penetrated along some kamacite/kamacite interfaces and rhabdite/kamacite boundaries, forming goethite and akaganéite.
Geochemistry: Composition of major phases (SEM/EDS, GeoZS): kamacite (Ni = 7.1 ± 0.4; N = 24), taenite (Ni = 30.1 ± 2.8; N = 12), phosphide (Ni = 45.7 ± 5.0, P = 17.9 ± 0.7; N = 16) (all in wt%). Bulk composition (ICP-MS; INAA, ActLab): Ni = 7.83, Co = 0.48 (both in wt%), Ga = 25, Ge = 47, Ir = 7.6, Pt = 13.4, As = 5.8 (all in ppm), Au = 472 ppb
Classification: Iron, medium octahedrite (IIIAB). Moderately shocked, extensively weathered.
Specimens: The type specimen of ~120 g is at GeoZS. Main mass held by Mr. V. Štibelj.

Java, IndonesiaFound: May 2008
Classification: Pallasite (Main group)
History: Anonymous finders recovered the meteorite specimen in 2008 during excavation activities in muddy ground.
Physical characteristics: The original mass of the meteorite boulder was 499.5 kg. It is spherically shaped with the shortest and longest diameter of 70 cm and 85 cm, respectively. The crust is weathered and rusty.
Petrography: The interior shows a homogeneous distribution of coarse-grained rounded olivine grains (6 to 12 mm). The groundmass is composed of secondary magnetite, nickel sulfide and sulfate (nickel hexahydrite), and primary schreibersite. Modal abundances are olivine (64 vol%), magnetite (23 vol%), nickel sulfide and sulfate (8 vol%), and schreibersite (5 vol%).
Geochemistry: Olivines are homogeneous in composition (Fa12-13). Sulfide is composed of NiS and may represent a replacement product of troilite, while magnetite (Fe3O4) is a weathering product of primary FeNi phases. Schreibersite has the composition (Fe1.85Ni1.15)P. Replicate analyses of oxygen isotopes were made on acid-washed samples by laser fluorination at UGött (A. Pack): δ17O (SMOW) 1.862, 1.367, 1.380; δ18O (SMOW) 3.820, 3.011, 3.160; and Δ17O -0.130  -0.200, -0.280 (all per mil).
Classification: Main group pallasite, extensively weathered, fresh olivine
Specimens: Type specimens of 230 g and 20 g with surface areas of 190 cm2 and 20 cm2, respectively, and one thin section are on deposit at UJena. An anonymous owner holds the main mass.

of the fall or discovery: The meteorite was found by a local resident
during haying. The meteorite was broken into two uneven parts with a sledge
hammer and left in a shed; only in July 1963 they were brought by I. A. Yudin
to the Urals Geological Museum (city of Sverdlovsk, USSR). The meteorite nature
of the stone was determined by I. A. Yudin and S. I. Smyshlyaev. The
regmaglipts and fusion crust observed on the meteorite show chan­ges due to
weathering.

Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, RussiaFound: July, 2011
Classification: Carbonaceous chondrite (CV3)
History: Tiny pieces of a chondrite were found during an expedition to Chukotka in far eastern Russia by scientists from the US, Russia and Italy, from July 20 to August 7, 2011, in search of icosahedrite [1, 2]. Members of the team were P. J. Steinhardt, C. Andronicos, L. Bindi, V. V. Distler, M. Eddy, A. Kostin, V. Kryachko, G. J. MacPherson, W. M. Steinhardt, and M. Yudovskaya. The search team removed 1.5 tons of clay and other material from dense gray-blue clay layers that are exposed along Listventovyi stream, and panned it to obtain the heavy fraction (within which the meteorite fragments were found). 
Physical characteristics: Seven grains were recovered during the 2011 expedition, and an additional three grains exist in St. Petersburg, Russia, and Florence, Italy, that were collected during a 1979 expedition; all are ~1 mm or less in maximum dimension. The total mass recovered is <0.1 g.
Petrography: (G. MacPherson, SI) The grains are dark gray with visible silicates and metal. Al-Cu alloy was observed on some of the grain surfaces. SEM examination of polished surfaces of two grains (#5 and #121) revealed that both are meteorite fragments, containing porphyritic olivine chondrules, chondrule fragments, and isolated olivine crystals in a porous matrix of olivine, calcium-rich clinopyroxene of diverse composition, nepheline, Ni-Fe metal, and Ni-Fe sulfide. The PO chondrules have Fa0-2 cores surrounded by Fe-rich mantles to Fa48. Zoning extends along internal crystalline fractures. The olivine cores show progressive primary zoning from essentially pure forsterite (Fa0) outward to ~Fa18. Interstitial to the olivine is enstatite (Fs1Wo1), which is rimmed by Fe-rich olivine. The matrix is porous and resembles that observed in CV3 chondrites, such as Allende, with olivine compositions of Fa48-50. The presence of awaruite (~68 wt. % Ni), Ni-rich sulfide (pentlandite with ~22 wt. % Ni), interstitial nepheline, and abundant clumps of Ca-rich clinopyroxene (mostly diopside, but variable) are again typical of CV3. Metal and sulfide mostly occur together in rounded (in some cases concentric) masses that also contain abundant Ca-phosphate. The sulfide encloses the metal. One CuAl metal alloy grain was found enclosed within the olivine of a chondrule. Among the meteorite grains recovered is a CAI fragment. It mainly is a porous aggregate of spinel grains with attached portions of CV3 meteorite matrix. The spinel is predominantly MgAl2O4, with varying contents of FeO (3-15 wt.%). This object is similar in most respects to the fine-grained spinel-rich inclusions found in CV3 chondrites (a variety of Ca-Al-rich inclusion), the only difference being that in other CV3 meteorites the spinel is generally rimmed by thin (few μm) layers of aluminous diopside. Diopside is present here as well, but only as a much thinner layer.
Geochemistry: Preliminary oxygen isotope analyses (SIMS: J. Eiler and Y. Guan, CalTech) of olivine plot on CCAM line at Δ17O ~ -5 to -10 permil. CAI spinel plots with all other CAI spinel at Δ17O ~ -20 permil.
Classification: The meteorite is a CV3 (oxidized) chondrite. The individual fragments show no signs of terrestrial weathering other than very minor, and only local, hematite, despite the fact that they occur in a sedimentary deposit.
Specimens:  10 known, each less than 1 mm in size. Three representative specimens have been deposited at SI.

Macroscopic Description: Kathleen McBride
The exterior of this meteorite has brown black fusion crust over 70% of its surface area. It has a rough texture and minor evaporates. The exposed interior has a rusty black color. The interior is a dark gray, almost metallic appearing, hard, dense material. Evaporites are present. A sulfurous odor emanates from the freshly broken faces. Circular shaped ""vugs"" less then 1 mm in size are visible.


Thin Section (, 4) Description: Tim McCoy, Linda Welzenbach 

The section shows an aggregate of chondrules (up to 1 mm), chondrule fragments, and pyroxene grains in a matrix of about 30% metal and sulfide. Chondrules contain moderate to small abundances of olivine. Weathering is modest, with staining of some enstatite grains and minor alteration of metal and sulfides. Microprobe analyses show the olivine is Fa0-1 and pyroxene is Fs0-2. The meteorite is a type 3 enstatite chondrite, probably an EH3.

The circunstenoes
of the discovery: The meteorite was found in the course of farm work by a
Mexican, Alfonso Robles, probably in early April 1956. It was carried to the
end of the row and thrown out, but later recognized, apparently partly thru its
weight, by Mr. Elmo Wade, the farm manager. He took it to his house. The stone
is quite old and weathered. One side has a definite though not thick deposit of
limestone. It is rounded and ellipsoidal in shape, with no outstanding features
or pittings. The original crust is hardly evident, only oxidation. There is one
fairly plane surface, indicating that the meteorite possibly broke along this
side and that a somewhat smaller piece should be in the region.
The main mass
of the meteorite is in the Pan American College at Edinburg, Texas, USA.

Macroscopic Description: Kathleen McBride
Dark brown/black patchy fusion crust covers 65% of the exterior. Exposed interior is dark in color with lighter inclusions. The interior is dark, ultramafic with a few light inclusions. This hard meteorite is rusty and has a coarse grained texture. Weathering is more extensive near the exterior.


Thin Section (,7) Description: Tim McCoy
The section consists of an aggregate of large olivine and pyroxene grains up to 2 mm across. Olivine grains are rimmed by carbon-rich material containing traces of metal. While these metal-bearing rims appear to define individual olivine crystals, those crystals exhibit subdomains a few hundred microns across in transmitted light and no reduction is observed between the subdomains. Olivine has cores of Fa19, with rims reduced to Fa2. Metal and sulfide form veins between the olivines, with metal often forming rounded blebs within the sulfide. The pyroxene grains are dominantly pigeonite (Fs7-9Wo7-9) and exhibit a wormy texture with elongate and irregular voids (graphite-filled?), and inclusions of metal and sulfide (sometimes associated with the voids). Within the pigeonites, but distinct from the voids, are found inclusions of subcalcic augite (Fs7-9Wo24-28) and, in association, an apparently non-stoichiometric phase highly enriched in SiO2, and contains Al2O3. The meteorite is an anomalous ureilite.

 farm in 1977, about 1 mile north and 4 miles west of
 Larned, Kansas. The mass was brought to the Big Well
 in Greensburg, Kansas in April 2007 and purchased by
 Dr. Donald Stimpson. Physical characteristics: A single mass weighing 28.1 kg
 surrounded by grayish to brownish, shaley weathering
 rind. The interior is mostly gray with metal visible in
 places, and it is transected by anastomosing, thin, dark
 brown veinlets. Petrography: (A. Irving and S. Kuehner, UWS; T.
 Bunch and J. Wittke, NAU): Polymict breccia
 composed mostly of large metal-poor clasts, but with
 locally abundant metal in the matrix. The major phase
 is near-pure enstatite (up to 1.2 cm, many exhibiting
 abundant fractures, mosaicism, and planar deformation
 features), with accessory diopside, schreibersite, sodic
 plagioclase glass, silica, Cr-bearing troilite, daubreelite,
 niningerite, Si-bearing kamacite, and rare taenite. One
 1.4 x 1.0 mm clast is a websterite composed of 52 vol%
 enstatite, 40 vol% diopside, and 8 vol% schreibersite
 and sulfides (including an iron sulfide phase
 compositionally similar to greigite). Silica exhibits
 ballen structures and occurs as inclusions in enstatite
 and is locally abundant in the matrix. Secondary veinlets are composed of a hydrous iron silicate
 compositionally similar to greenalite. Geochemistry: Enstatite (Fs0.1–0.2Wo0.4–1.1), diopside
 (Fs0.2Wo47), plagioclase glass (~Ab79Or21), kamacite (Si
 1.35–2.2 wt%, Ni 5.9–6.6 wt%), taenite (Si 1.1 wt%, Ni
 12.6 wt%). Classification: Achondrite (aubrite, anomalous). This
 large specimen contains more metal and more silica
 polymorph than most aubrites, and has experienced a
 high degree of shock (producing fractured enstatite,
 ballen silica and feldspathic glass). Specimens: A total of 190 g of sample and two polished
 thin sections are on deposit at UWS. The main mass is held
 by DStimpson.

Antofagasta, ChileFound: 2001
Classification: Iron, IIIAB
History: A mass of 528 g was found by Jim Labenne in a place named Las Cruces, 16 km east of the Antofagasta Airport.
Physical characteristics: The mass has the average dimension of 100 × 50 × 30 mm. The top is covered by pockmarks, with small wide pits with sharp ridges characteristic of irons from the Atacama Desert.  On the top one large depression clearly indicates the former location of a large troilite nodule.
Petrography: Small section 30 × 25 mm examined. Medium octahedrite with bandwidth 0.8 mm. Few inclusions. No FeS recognized. Small schreibersites inside kamacite bands near band intersections, two larger (1-3 mm) outside kamacite. Little weathering but no heat altered zone recognized.
Geochemistry: Composition: 5.32  mg/g Co, 91.5 mg/g Ni,  20.6 μg/g Ga,  <50 μg/g Ge,  12.5 μg/g As, 0.177 μg/g Ir, and 1.459 μg/g Au.  Based on the composition and structure, the iron belongs to group IIIAB.  Las Cruces is resolved from Los Reyes (Ir = 0.128 μg/g) in terms of Ir but cannot be compositionally resolved from the observed fall Juromenha.
Classification: Iron IIIAB.

Petrography: (M.E.Zucolotto, MNRJ; L.L. Antonello, CBPF) The meteorite shows a few well-defined chondrules and fragments dispersed in a recrystallized matrix. The best-preserved chondrules are RP and BO. The chondrule sizes vary, mostly between 0.5 to 2.0 mm. Opaque phases are kamacite, taenite, troilite and tetratenite. The latter is observed as a thin layer that borders taenite and plessite. Kamacite is mostly polycrystalline and in some cases the plessite shows pearlitic structure bordered by tetrataenite. Sulfides are abundant and are mainly present as single grains. In places small plagioclase grains (partially isotropic) are observed. Some oxide veins as well as iddingsite penetrate along olivine fractures. Minor oxide is present around some metal grains. Melt pockets are scarce and small. Olivine grains have rims with planar fractures but clean cores, in which weakly mosaic and/or undulatory extinction is observed.
Geochemistry: (M.E.Varela, ICATE; R. Scorzelli, CBPF) Mean compositions are olivine (Fa25) and low-Ca pyroxene (Fs22.6).
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (L5); S3-4; weathering W1
Specimens: 57 g plus three thin sections are on deposit in MNRJ. Main mass with Dr. A. Roisemberg, UFRGS.

Macroscopic Description,: Roberta Score
Thin, shiny fusion crust with flow marks coats most of the top of LEW85300. The bottom surface has some fusion crust but most of this face is a fracture surface which appears to have been moderately polished. Fusion crust appears as dull patches on 85302 and 85303. Several large semi-rounded polymineralic clasts (as large as 2 x 2 cm in dimension) have sharply defined edges and are set in a black matrix that is made up of minute inclusions.
 
Cleaving the stones in half revealed an interior that is lighter in color than the exterior. Several different sharply defined clasts, including white, fine-grained clasts and black aphanitic clasts, were exposed. One large interior area shows extensive oxidation.
 
Thin Section (LEW85300,12; ,13; ,14) Description: James L. Gooding and Brian Mason
,12: A large ( 6 mm apparent maximum dimension) light-colored clast is enclosed by finer-grained dark matrix. Clast is composed of subhedral clinopyroxene and plagioclase (typical grain size is a few tenths mm) in a groundmass of granular pyroxene. Both clinopyroxene and plagioclase are cloudy and show crenulated and undulatory extinction under crossed polars. Some clinopyroxene crystals show very fine herringbone texture (probably exsolution lamellae). Ilmenite (?) is abundant in the clast and occurs as irregular grains of 0.01-0.2 mm size. Matrix surrounding clast is a porous, clastic aggregate of pyroxene and plagioclase mineral fragments with characteristic grain sizes of 0.1-0.2 mm, but with increasingly finer grains between the large grains. Other optical properties of pyroxene and plagioclase are similar to those described for the clast.
 
,13: Nearly all of exposed area is subophitic basalt that is comparable in grain size to the clast in ,12, but with much better preserved igneous texture. Clinopyroxene has pronounced herringbone texture (more abundant than in ,12) and ilmenite (?) is an accessory phase.
 
,14: At least two large clasts (~4-5 mm) of subophitic basalt (with ilmenite (?)) float in a finer-grained clastic matrix, as in ,12. At least two irregular grains of Ni-Fe metal (one ~0.015 mm, the other ~0.12 mm) occur, with the larger one being in the matrix and the smaller one in a clast. The most interesting feature of this section is a dark clast (~2-3 mm size) that resembles a fragment of carbonaceous chondrite (possibly C3). Most of this clast consists of an opaque matrix of low reflectivity (resembles reflectivity of magnetite) with a floating framework of cloudy, irregular, polymineralic clasts and isolated single-crystal mineral fragments. Some of the clasts are nearly spherical but resemble ""inclusions"" more than ""chondrules""; olivine might exist in some of them. Both the border of this clast and objects within it are defined by haloes of dispersed, very fine-grained sulfides. One small grain of possible Ni-Fe metal was observed.
 
Microprobe analyses of the LEW85300,14 section (by B. Mason) show pyroxene compositions clustering around Wo3Fs60 and ranging to Wo43Fs26, with the mean of 15 analyses Wo12Fs52; two grains with composition Wo3Fs33 were found. Plagioclase ranges in composition An84-93 with a mean of An89. The dark clast is a fragment of a C3 carbonaceous chondrite, consisting largely of fine-grained olivine, ranging in composition Fa1-44; one grain of clinoenstatite (Fs5) and one of spinel (FeO 0.8%) were analysed. The meteorite is a eucrite with a C3 clast."

Classification: Ordinary chondrite (H, melt rock)
History: Russell Williams found a single stone in 14 pieces while prospecting for gold in the Little Harquahala Mountains of Arizona, La Paz County, on January 2006.
Petrography: (Laurence Garvie, ASU) Low-Ca pyroxene and olivine with lesser albitic plagioclase, Fe-Ni, troilite and minor Ca-phosphate, Cr-rich diopside, and Al-rich glass. Much of the metal has been oxidized. The rock is mostly recrystallized and fine-grained, without recognizable chondrules. The grains display a hypidiomorphic texture. The section is dominated by subhedral and polygonal low-Ca pyroxene (typically 0.1 to 0.3 mm, some to 0.7 mm) and euhedral to anhedral olivine (typically <50 μm, with sparse grains to 0.2 mm). The pyroxene occurs as clusters showing a granoblastic texture, with intervening finer-grained pyroxene, olivine, and intersertal plagioclase. The low-Ca pyroxene grains contain an abundance of chadacrysts and inclusions, primarily olivine, but also Cr-rich diopside, Al-rich glass, and troilite.
Geochemistry: (Laurence Garvie, ASU) Olivine Fa19.25 (range 18.43 to 19.68), with FeO/MnO = 38.49; low-Ca pyroxene Fs16.92Wo4.38 (Fs ranges from 16.10 to 18.66 and Wo from 3.19 to 7.12); and plagioclase An16.43Or2.36. One 50-μm diopside grain was found Fs9.28Wo39.22 with 1.2 wt% Cr2O3. Oxygen isotopes replicate analyses (R. Tanaka, OkaU) of acid washed, bulk sample by laser fluorination gave δ17O = 3.147 and 3.158‰; δ18O = 4.571 and 4.750‰; Δ17O = 0.739 and 0.656‰.
Classification: H chondrite melt rock, degree of weathering is moderate and shock is low. The meteorite lacks a chondritic texture but has mineral and oxygen isotope compositions with H-chondrite affinities. This stone shows similarities with NWA 2353, 2635, and 3145.
Specimens: ASU holds 25.98 g and three thin sections. Main mass R. Williams and J. Blennert.

Classification: Iron meteorite (IIIAB)
History: A single 4318 g mass (weight after small piece cut off end) was found by Thomas Hobbs in 1975 while he was searching for meteorites with a metal detector around a ""meteor crater"" just north of Junction, Texas. Mr. and Mrs. Hobbs kept the mass until their curiosity was piqued after watching a television show on meteorites in early 2010. A small end piece was sent to ASU and confirmed to be a meteorite.
Physical characteristics: Slightly elongated cuboid stone. Surface moderately weathered with small patches of corroded fusion crust. A few broad regmaglypts cover half the stone, the other side being smoother.

Manitoba, CanadaFound: 2005
Classification: Iron meteorite (IAB-sLL)
History: The meteorite was found on a gravel bar of the Whiteshell River just before it empties into Lone Island Lake, in the Whiteshell Provincial Park.
Physical characteristics: (S. Kissin, LHU) Consists of 14 pieces weighing 4.8 kg.  The exterior is smooth and highly weathered with rusty areas occuring along cracks.  The interior displays pervasive oxidation.
Petrography: (S. Kissin, LHU) Cut and polished surfaces display three prominent lamellae directions at ~60° intersection angles. There is also a fourth direction present as large, irregular kamacite patches. Average kamacite bandwidth is 1.16±0.28 mm (n=15). Kamacite lamellae are polygonalized with a l:w ratio of 15:1 and have developed secondary fracturing in areas of intense oxidation. Neumann bands are present but somewhat obscured by oxidation. Taenite lamellae are narrow and often well preserved.  Rhabdites are present within the kamacite, but are not abundant as they seem to have been destroyed by oxidation in some areas.  No troilite found.
Geochemistry: (S. Kissin, LHU)  Ni=76.2, Co=4.25 (both mg/g); As=15.9, Au=1.77, Cr=71, Cu=142, Ga=80, Ge=400, Ir=1.84, Pt=9.3, Sb=0.29, W=0.81 (all μg/g); Re=170 (ng/g).  Obtained by neutron activation analyses.

Macroscopic Description: Kathleen McBride
This meteorite is shaped like a volcanic bomb and has a rusty-colored,
exfoliating, flaky exterior. It is dull on one side and shiny
on the opposite side. Thick evaporitic material is present on
two exterior surfaces. The flaky crust has numerous surface cracks
that do not penetrate the interior and run mostly in the longitudinal
direction. The weathered crust extends a few millimeters into
the interior. The interior is very fresh compared to the exterior
and proved to be very coherent and extremely hard. The interior
is fine-grained and varies in color from steel-gray to black with
interstitial white to clear crystals.

Thin Section (,6) Description: Brian Mason
Only vague traces of chondritic structure are visible in the thin
section, which shows the meteorite to consist largely of granular
to prismatic enstatite (grain size 0.1-0.2 mm), about 20% nickel-iron,
minor amounts of sulfides, and a little plagioclase. The enstatite
is almost pure MgSiO3 (Fe 0.1-0.6%, Ca 0.7-0.9%). The metal contains
0.9% Si. One grain of plagioclase, An17, was analyzed. The meteorite
is an E6 chondrite.

Two stones, weighing 452.6 and 245.4 g, respectively, were found by Bob Verish in his backyard while he was cleaning out a box of rocks that was part of his rock collection.  The specimens may have been collected ~ 20 years ago in the Mojave Desert.  Classification and mineralogy (A. Rubin, P. Warren, and J. Greenwood, UCLA):  a basalt with a texture closely resembling that of the QUE 94201; plagioclase laths, 43.6 vol%, An41Or4 to An58Or1, have been shocked to maskelynite; Ca-pyroxene, 37.7 vol%, ranges from Fs45Wo13 to Fs45Wo37 to Fs72Wo24; other mineral modes (in vol%), silica = 4.9, fayalite = 4.2, K-rich felsic glass = 2.4, titanomagnetite = 3.5, Ca phosphate = 2.7 (including whitlockite and chlorapatite), pyrrhotite = 0.7, and ilmenite = 0.2; contains a higher proportion of plagioclase than Shergotty or Zagami, and has pyroxene that is moderately more ferroan than that in QUE 94201.  Specimens:  main masses with finder; 30 g, UCLA; 20 g, SI. Note, one may encounter references to the two masses as Los Angeles 001 and 002, or stone no. 1 and stone no. 2, respectively; these are unofficial designations. "

Classification: HED achondrite (Diogenite, polymict)
Physical characteristics: One stone was found with a total weight of 73 g. Dull, moderately weathered black fusion crust covers ~80% of the stone. The interior of the stone is grey with minor iron-oxide staining.
Petrography: (Laurence Garvie, ASU) Orthopyroxene-rich breccia with clasts (<1 to 5 mm) and mineral fragments with a range of textures and compositions, supported by fine-grained orthopyroxene matrix. The majority of the clasts (~90%) rounded to angular, unzoned low Ca-pyroxene (Fs24.1-33.4Wo2.0-3.0), and large (mm-sized) opaque-rich (FeS and chromite) low Ca-pyroxene (Fs20.1-26.5Wo0.4-2.4). Plagioclase clasts (An84.5-93.9Or0.2-0.5) abundant. Thin section contains a range of clast types, with a diversity of lithologies some with cumulate eucrite texture and compositions and other unique clasts: mm-sized, divergent plagioclase (An70.7-72.2Or1.1-1.3) with interstitial Fs14.8Wo41.9 and silica grains; mm-sized clast of Fs38.2Wo2.9 and An93.8Or0.1; zoned low Ca-pyroxene with Fs22.8Wo2.44 at center and Fs30.4Wo2.6 at grain edge; large (mm-sized) pyroxene with complex zoning, Fs38.6Wo2.7 with lamellae of Fs19.8Wo40.5, grain center is Fs46.9Wo2.1, also contains chadacrysts of An85.4Or0.3; 100 μm clast of An84.5Or0.5 with 10 μm chadacrysts of Fs12.0Wo44.4; large (mm) Fs43.3Wo7.0 grain with lamellae of Fs36.2Wo19.7; and large (mm) Fs36.2Wo3.6 grain with lamellae of Fs20.0Wo40.1. Silica and chromite (to 1 mm) scattered throughout the section. Also sparse kamacite and Ti-spinel.
Classification: Achondrite (diogenite, polymict breccia); Shock level is moderate, with variable shock levels in clasts. Minimal weathering. Visually, the stone looks like a howardite with dark  clasts similar to NWA 776. However, the predominance of unzoned low-Ca pyroxene is more consistent with diogenites and the diversity of lithologies warrant the polymict designation.Specimens: Type specimen, 73 g, ASU; main mass, E.

Find: January 1981
Iron (ataxite, ungrouped)
History: Found on the beach while the finder was picking seashells at low tide.
Physical characteristics: Striking oblong 8.2 kg, weathered iron with cm-scale pyramids projecting from upper surface (orientation as found on beach) and cm-sized vugs in lower surface. The pyramids have ribs spaced approximately at mm intervals.
Petrography: (R. Flemming, P. Corcoran UWO; S. Kissin, LU) Initial examination of the meteorite exterior by in situ micro-XRD identified taenite but no kamacite. Awaruite (Ni-dominant alloy) was also identified as co-structural with the taenite. Examination by reflected light microscopy and SEMEDX of a polished thin section from near the weathered surface of Lovina revealed abundant globular troilite nodules up to 0.8 mm in diameter in a featureless Fe-Ni-Co alloy matrix. The metal contains no kamacite exsolution lamellae nor are there Neumann lines. Many of troilite nodules are partially or totally oxidized and show Ni-enriched awaruite rims in the adjacent metal. Small Cr-oxide grains (~10 µm) occur with the troilite.
Geochemistry: (S. Kissin, LU) Bulk composition (INAA): Co = 0.87, Ni = 34.5 (both wt%); Cu = 395, Ga = 22, Ge = 150, As = 5.6, Sb = 390, W <10, Re < 0.01, Ir = 0.252, Pt < 0.5, Au = 0.07, Cr = 321 (all ppm).

Mafuta Farm, Makonde District, Zimbabwe
Find: 1 December 1984
Iron (IID)
History: On 1 December 1984, while clearing rocks
from his fields with an assistant, Mr. Murray Alexander found an iron meteorite
on Mafuta Farm, Makonde District, northern Zimbabwe. In 1993, Mr. Alexander
agreed to have a slice cut for scientific studies. The cutting was done in Harare and a slice (about 9.5 × 4.5 × 1 cm) was sent to Vienna for further studies.
Physical Characteristics: (C. Koeberl, UVien)
The original mass and dimensions were 71.5 kg and 40 × 20 cm, respectively. The
exterior has little rust and a brownish color. Petrography: A medium
octahedrite (kamacite band width between 0.4 and 1.1 mm) and rich in schreibersite
(up to 5 mm), but it does not contain any large sulfide exposed on the large
slice. The kamacite is recrystallized to an equigranular intergrowth of ~0.5 mm
grains.
Geochemistry: Bulk composition: (C. Koeberl, UVien;
INAA J. Wasson UCLA; PIXE W. Przybylowicz, NACSA) First sample:
Ni = 9.7 1, Co = 0.61 (both wt%), Cr = 32, Ga = 67, As = 4.8, Os = 13.3, Ir =
15.0 (all ppm), and Au = 615 ppb. Second sample: Ni = 10.03, Co = 0.67 (both
wt%), Cr = 62, Cu = 246, Ga = 72.7, As = 5.0, W = 2.92, Ir = 15.4, Pt = 19.8
(all ppm), and Au = 645 ppb.
Classification: (J. Wasson, UCLA) Iron (IID).
Specimens: A total of 221 g of sample is on deposit
at the NHMV (inventory number M6694). Mr. M. Alexander of Mafuta Farm, Zimbabwe, holds the main mass.

Date of
discovery:  FOUND, Ju1y 1955, identified July 10, 1956.
Class and
type: STONE, black chondrite.
The number
of separate specimens: 2, (However, it is the opinion of Mr. W.S. Houston
and E.P. Henderson that it is s fragment of a larger mass that was broken off
before it fell). It measures 10"" x 8"" x 6'', A fragment 2"" x 1.5""
x 1"" was also found.
Total
weight: After some slices were removed the known weight is 6,905 grams. 
The
circumstances of the discovery: Sometime in July 1955, when Mr. Roberts was
visiting his farm pond which lies a half mile back of the house he noticed a
stone sticking out of the aground just at the top of the bank. Curious, because
it seemed a different color fromn the local rocks, he dug it out. It wasn't especially
heavy. The original weight was taken but is now lost, but at present, after
cutting some 6,906 grams remain. It is obviously a fragment off a larger piece,
broken on impact, or at any rate near enough to the ground so that no secondary
crust formed. Only about a third of the surface shows the original crust.
The chondrite
has also obviously been in the ground for a long time. The broken surface is
the same reddish color as the crust area, and the crust has no black on it at all.
Main mass is
in the Kansas State College, Manhatten, Kansas. About 5 grams are in the U.S.
National Museum.

MER landing site, Meridiani Planum, Mars
Find: 5 January 2005
Iron (IAB complex)
History: While exploring the remnants of the heat shield on Meridiani Planum, the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Opportunity imaged the surroundings with its panoramic camera (PanCam). On sol 324, a close-by object with a maximum dimension of 31 cm across became for the first time clearly visible in one of these images. Subsequent PanCam images reveal a smooth rock surface covered by depressions partly reminiscent of regmaglypts.
Classification and Description: (Athena Science Team) Spectra obtained by the Miniature Thermal Emission spectrometer on sol 339 and 342 show a thermal emissivity of 0.35, which is only consistent with metal indicating that the object was an iron meteorite. Detailed investigations from sol 349 to 352 by the in situ instruments on the rover’s arm, the Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT), Microscopic Imager (MI), Mössbauer Spectrometer (MB), and Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS), confirmed the metallic nature and allowed classification. Classification based on analyses of a brushed surface: MB, ~94% of the Fe is bound in kamacite, and APXS, dust corrected composition of iron is Ni = ~7 wt%; Ge = ~300, Ga = <70 (both ppm), consistent with its classification as an iron (IAB complex).

Carbonaceous chondrite (CM1)
History: The specimen was found by Sonny Clary in September, 2004, in the Moapa Valley, southeast of Logandale, Nevada. 
Physical characteristics: A single dark gray, flattened stone (698.8 g), exhibiting subparallel contraction cracks and partially coated with black, vesicular fusion crust. 
Petrography (A. Irving and S. Kuehner, UWS): Rounded to ellipsoidal objects (0.05 to 0.7 mm across), exhibiting a preferred orientation of their long axes, are set in a fine-grained, dark matrix containing small clusters of sulfide grains. The larger objects are composed mainly of serpentine minerals and S-bearing phase(s) (probably tochinilite), and in thin section range in color from pale yellow-brown to reddish brown to sepia brown; some such objects have serpentine-rich rims and/or larger, subhedral, dark brown grains composed of serpentine/cronstedtite. Sulfides consist of finely intergrown pyrrhotite and pentlandite. Rare magnetite and calcite are present in the matrix, and the specimen is traversed by narrow open fractures and thin veinlets filled with chalcedony. 
Geochemistry: Broad-beam EMP analysis of different components gave the following compositions (in wt%): ellipsoidal objects SiO2 31.7–38.4, TiO2 0.07–0.25, Al2O3 1.8–7.2, Cr2O3 0.19–0.73, FeO 15.9–26.3, MnO 0.07–0.18, MgO 22.7–28.8, CaO 0.06–0.25, Na2O 0.04–0.29, SO3 0.03–0.87, sum 85.7–87.4; matrix SiO2 27.1–28.4, TiO2 0.11–0.16, Al2O3 2.7, Cr2O3 0.48–0.57, FeO 34.1–39.7, MnO 0.20–0.25, MgO 14.7–16.5, CaO 0.36–2.9, Na2O 0.21–0.42, SO3 3.9–8.5, sum 89.9–94.1. 
Oxygen isotopes (D. Rumble, CIW): analyses of two acid-washed whole rock fragments by laser fluorination gave, respectively, δ18O = 6.29, 6.08‰; δ17O = 0.93, 0.68‰; Δ17O = −2.382, −2.519‰. 
Classification: Carbonaceous chondrite (CM1). The degree of terrestrial weathering is low. 
Specimens: A total of 21 g, one polished thin section and one polished mount are on deposit at UWS. Mr. S. Clary holds the main mass. "

Northwest Province, South Africa, near the small town of Morokweng 
Find June 2004 
LL6 ordinary chondrite 
History: The meteorite was found by Dr. Marco Andreoli in June 2004 while conducting a detailed petrographic description of the M3 borehole. The M3 borehole had been drilled in 2000 to investigate the mineral potential of the ~30 km meltsheet of the ~144 Ma Morokweng impact crater. The meteorite was intersected at a depth of ~766 m within the 870 m thick meltsheet. Petrographic and compositional evidence indicates the presence of many other, smaller fragments in various stages of recrystallization (Hart et al. 2002). 
Physical characteristics: The main mass is ~750 g. The meteorite is mostly unaltered, apart from a thin (~1 mm) brown corona containing unidentified Fe silicates and K-rich sheet silicates interpreted to be the result of alteration by the meltsheet. 
Petrography W. D. Maier (UQué, Pretoria), M. A. G. Andreoli (SANEC, Wits), I. McDonald (Cardiff), M. D. Higgins (UQué), A. J. Boyce (SUERC), A. Shukolyukov (Scripps), G. W. Lugmair (Scripps), L. D. Ashwal (Wits), P. Graeser (UPret), E. Ripley (IU), and R. Hart (Ithemba): Apart from the thin (1 mm) corona containing brown alteration minerals, the meteorite is seemingly unaltered. Petrographic study revealed diagnostic features of a highly equilibrated chondrite breccia, including numerous subangular chondrite fragments, and several well-preserved chondrules of porphyritic pyroxene, barred olivine, and radial pyroxene. The number of preserved chondrules is relatively low. Both minerals commonly show undulatory and mosaic extinction. The matrix material has a well-developed granular texture with 120° triple junctions. 
Geochemistry: Both olivine (Fo67–70) and orthopyroxene (En69–73) are homogenous within individual grains and throughout the meteorite. Plagioclase is mostly An33–50, some to An17, chromite has 44–48% Cr2O3. Pyrrhotite has composition Fe0.85–0.87S and pentlandite (Fe,Ni)1.02–1.10S. The bulk chemistry of the large clast is chondritic, although U, Th, La and Ce are enriched and Na, K are depleted compared to the average compositions for ordinary chondrites. Absolute PGE (Ir = 234 ppb; Ru = 351 ppb; Rh = 81 ppb; Pt = 478 ppb; Pd = 361 ppb), Ni (5850 ppm) and Co (326 ppm) concentrations are ~30–40% lower than in average LL chondrites. Despite the absence of metal, the bulk Fe content of the clast is chondritic. Bulk S isotope analyses yielded δ34S values of −0.1‰ and −0.4‰, and individual sulphide minerals analysed by in situ laser combustion revealed a range of values from −0.9‰ to +0.1‰. 53Cr/52Cr ratio in the large clast is 0.38 ± 0.05ε. 
Classification: LL6 chondrite, shock stage S5, weathering grade W0. Specimens: A total of ~20 g is on deposit at the Transvaal Museum, Pretoria, South Africa. Dr W. D. Maier holds the main mass. Dr. M. Andreoli holds 4 small pieces (between 2 and 22 g). "

Thin Section (,2) Description: Tim McCoy and Valerie Reynolds
The meteorites are so similar that a single description suffices.  The sections show a groundmass of comminuted pyroxene
and plagioclase (up to 0.5 mm) with fine- to coarse-grained basaltic clasts ranging up to 5 mm.  PRA 04401 contains
particularly abundant CM2 clasts.   Orthopyroxene compositions span a range of Fs16-60Wo1-3, although a single grain
of Fs1 was observed, presumably from the CM2 clast.  The Fe/Mn ratio is ~30 and feldspar is anorthitic (An87-90).  The
meteorites are howardites.

The owner found
an iron meteorite on the ground, approximately 27 × 23 × 12 cm (exact weight
unknown but estimated at ~30 kg). Mineralogy and classification (D. H. Hill, UAz):
the specimen appears to have a complete fusion crust with some regmaglypts. The
meteorite has two textural regions—one structureless and one with
recrystallised, 1 mm-sized domains, suggestive of pre-atmospheric heating and
subsequent annealing. Bulk composition (D. H. Hill, UAz): Fe = 91.35%,
Ni = 5.339%, Ga = 59.1 ppm, Ir = 12.75 ppm, Co = 4227 ppm, Au = 0.54 ppm, As =
3.66 ppm, Sb = 0.051 ppm. Specimens: type specimen, 134 g, UAz; main

The larger mass tends to have a crude conical to hemispherical shape with the nose partially buried in the soil. The axis is inclined at an angle of approximately 60°. Evidence of fragmentation of a larger mass is afforded by a sharp, angular, vertical face on the larger mass, which matches both in size and shape, a similar sharp face on the smaller mass. Preliminary study indicates that the meteorite came from the west at relatively low velocity and high angle. The larger mass has been presented to the Western Australian Museum, while the smaller mass is in Geosurveys possesion (Adelaide, South Australia). Source: Report of Dr. R. B.

Find location unknownPurchased: May 2007
Classification: Iron, IIIAB
History: Meteorite was purchased by Labenne from Mark Grubb, who reported that his grandfather purchased  the meteorite in about 1965 from the captain of a fishing vessel in New York. The Cape York IIIAB irons have a wide range in compositions (e.g., Ir ranges from 3.0 to 5.7 mg/g) and the composition of this meteorite, with the exception of slightly low As, falls near the high-Ir end of the range. It is possible that this is a Cape York iron, possibly purchased from an Inuit by the ship captain.
Physical characteristics: The mass has the average dimension of 90 × 110 × 80 mm. In the past a large piece was removed and the cut surface polished and etched; a thick patina of rust has developed on this surface.
Petrography: Small section (10 × 12 mm) examined; bandwidth not well defined, 0.90±2 mm. Meteorite weathered on exterior; Widmanstätten pattern is visible in a region 3 mm thick. Plessite mottled, distorted and recrystallized. One small 0.7 × 3.3 mm FeS grain has a metal band crossing it; band has thin FeS stripes oriented parallel to its long axis. No schreibersite was recognized. Meteorite experienced preterrestrial shock followed by annealing and recrystallization.
Geochemistry: Composition: 4.99  mg/g Co, 76.6 mg/g Ni,  18.4 μg/g Ga,  <50 μg/g Ge,  3.73 μg/g As, 5.29 μg/g Ir, and 0.594 μg/g Au.  Based on the composition and structure, the iron belongs to group IIIAB.  The only close relative may be Toubil River.  However, only the 20% low As content is inconsistent with it being part of the Cape York compositional trend described by Esbensen et al. (1982); it may be a slightly deviant member of the Cape York shower.

Ordinary chondrite (LL5)
History: Two stones with a mass of 591 and 188 g, respectively (total known weight 779 g), were found by a Moroccan mineral collector (Sajid Ait Ben Chouk) near the caravansary of Noktat Addagmar after locals reported an abundance of “stones that recently fell from sky”, close to the track from Assa (Morocco) to Nouakchott (Mauritania). 
Physical characteristics: The main mass is partly covered with a black fusion crust. The interior is greenish grey with slight rust haloes around metal. Porosity 8.2% based on alcohol absorption. 
Petrography: (E. Gnos, MHNGE; B. Hofmann, NMBE, M. Eggimann, UBE/NMBE) Olivine Fa27.7 ± 0.6 (n = 27), pyroxene Fs23.1 ± 1.0 Wo1.6 ± 0.3. (n = 20). Shock stage is S2, some shock veins are visible, no weathering (W0). The mean diameter of chondrules is ~1 mm. 
Cosmogenic radionuclides: (Patrick Weber, Particle Physics Group, Institute of Physics, University of Neuchâtel) Gamma-spectroscopy performed in December-January 2006 demonstrated the absence of short-lived radionuclides (no 22Na detected). The fall must have occurred at least several decades ago. 
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (LL5), shock stage S2, no weathering (W0). 
Type specimens: 22.4 g plus polished thin section at NMBE, main mass: Svend Buhl, Hamburg, Germany. "

Lunar meteorite (anorthositic regolith breccia)

A brownish gray stone weighing 262 g was found by a
prospector in northern Sudan near the Libya/Egypt/Sudan boundary in 2002 April.
 Fusion crust is absent, fresh surface is gray to dark gray, and
terrestrial alteration products are present at the meteorite edges and in
penetrating cracks and veins.  Classification and mineralogy (J. Haloda
and P. Tycova, PCU): a clast-rich anorthositic regolith breccia
containing numerous mineral fragments and lithic clasts embedded in a
well-consolidated microcrystalline impact melt matrix. Lithic clasts (up to 1
cm in size) are mainly of anorthositic lithologies; impact-melt breccias of
anorthositic composition are abundant and show commonly breccia-in-breccia
textures.  Fragments of primary igneous rocks of anorthositic to gabbroic
composition are common, containing plagioclase An95.1-97.2, low-Ca pyroxene
En46-65 Wo2.1-5 and high-Ca pyroxene En35-48Wo37-44 and rare olivine
Fo79.4.  Sparse clasts of mare basalts (consisting of
pigeonite+anorthite+accessory ilmenite), and glass fragments and spherules are
present.  Mineral fragments are of various composition: feldspar, An92-99;
orthopyroxene, Wo2-4En49-80; clinopyroxene, Wo9-39En50-87; olivine, Fo48-82
(Fe/Mn 93-100 atom%); accessory minerals are Mg-Al spinel, chromite,
ilmenite (2-5 wt% MgO), troilite, FeNi metal and silica.  Several pyroxene
grains have marginal symplectitic intergrowths of fayalite+hedenbergite+silica
after former pyroxferroite.  Composition of the impact-melt matrix is
(wt%): SiO2 = 45.7, Al2O3 = 24.1, FeO = 7.2,
MgO = 7.4, CaO = 14.6, Na2O = 0.5, TiO2 = 0.5. 
Secondary calcite, barite, gypsum and Fe hydroxides occur in cracks.

Mora County, New Mexico
Find: 1986
Iron (IAB-MG), coarse octahedrite 
History:  This single 6.4 kg mass was found by a local New Mexico hunter in 1986.  Knowing it was different from the surrounding rocks and had an odd appearance (the face of a bear), the hunter took it home and set it aside with an odd assortment of 'collectibles' while hunting and mountaineering over decades in the New Mexico area.  The owner contacted G. Hupe in May 2008 for verification of the find, which was confirmed by study of the type sample at the University of Alberta.
Physical characteristics:  A single stone weighing 6402 grams with virtually no apparent fusion crust, yet also lacking progressed terrestrial alteration, which contributes towards its dark brown metallic appearance with well defined regmaglypts.
Petrography: (C. Herd, N. Bruemmer, UAb) A 5 x 7 cm polished and etched slab reveals Widmanstätten pattern with an average bandwidth of 1.4 ± 0.2 mm, few areas of plessite, and numerous inclusions.  A 1 cm ellipsoidal graphite nodule and several smaller inclusions of graphite, troilite and schreibersite are associated with polygonal kamacite on one portion of the slab. Smaller, mm-scale elongate inclusions of troilite are oriented parallel to kamacite lamellae where the Widmanstätten is better developed. Terrestrial oxides decorate fractures within a few mm of the exterior surface.
Geochemistry: Bulk Composition: INAA data (J. Duke, UAb): Ni = 6.99 ± 0.05 wt%, Co = 0.466 ± 0.004 wt%, Ga = 71.9 ± 0.3 μg/g, Ge = 271 ± 6 μg/g, Ir = 2.25 ± 0.04 μg/g, Au = 1.60 ± 0.03 μg/g, As = 15.2 ± 0.3 μg/g, Cu = 119 ± 11 μg/g, W = 0.87 ± 0.08 μg/g, Re = 0.22 ± 0.02 μg/g (uncertainties 1s, 68% confidence level). 
Classification: Iron meteorite, IAB main group, coarse octahedrite, minimal shock, minimal weathering.
Type specimens: 97.58 g slab and a 3.2 g interior piece, UAb, main mass, G. Hupe."

Classification: Ordinary chondrite (L6)
History: Several broken weathered pieces were found on the surface by A Tomkins, and then another 30 odd pieces were recovered by the team over an area of ~ 100 m2.
Physical characteristics: Many fragments of weathered dark brown material, no fusion crust  discernible.
Petrography: (A. Tomkins, Monash) Poorly defined chondrules to 6 mm, sit in a strongly recrystallized matrix. Some plagioclase-dominated domains exceed 300 μm. Chondrule types include RP, POP, PP, BO and PO. Olivine grains show mosaicism and planar deformation fractures, plagioclase has been converted to maskelynite. Fe-Ni metal grains are almost completely rusted out, and the majority of troilite has been destroyed by weathering.
Geochemistry: (A. Tomkins, Monash) Microprobe analyses show that olivine and pyroxene have uniform compositions: olivine Fa25.0-26.1, mean=25.44 mol%, std=0.41, n=5; Low-Ca pyroxene Fs21.7-22.2, mean=21.90 mol%, std=0.21, n=5.

Circumstances of find: Two stones were found on February 4, 1969 by J. Ph. Lefranc, geologist at the Centre de Recherches sur les Zones Arides, C.N.R.S., Paris, collaborator with the Algerian Geological Survey. They were found 95 m apart on Quaternary sandy gravel overlying the Cretaceous Plateau. The large stone was intact, the small one had a broken surface. Peculiarly well preserved, the two stones had sharp points thrust into the sandy gravel that had been recently compacted by rain. They were marked by a few drops of rain on the top. The last rain before the discovery of the stones had been on the night of January 9 or 10, 1969. It can be presumed that the stones fell about the end of the rainfall on the morning of January 10, 1969.

Physical Description: Roberta Score
90% of this specimen is covered with brown and black fusion
crust which is pitted in some areas. One corner has been broken off to reveal a
vein of weathered material from 1 to 5 mm wide, which is a much darker gray
than the less weathered matrix. The interior is marked by abundant chondrules
and irregular shaped inclusions. Dimensions: 3.5 x 3 x 2 cm.
 
Petrographic Description: Brian Mason
The section shows a close-packed aggregate of chondrules and
some irregular granular enclaves; the matrix consists of fine-grained silicates
with a moderate amount of nickel-iron and a lesser amount of troilite.
Chondrules range up to 1.1 mm across, and show a variety of types, the
commonest being granular olivine and olivine-pyroxene (polysynthetically
twinned clinobronzite), porphyritic olivine, and fine-grained pyroxene. Some
intergranular glass in the chondrules is clear and transparent, but much of it
is turbid and partly devitrified. Minor brown limonitic staining is present
around nickel-iron grains. Microprobe analyses show olivine and pyroxene with
variable composition: olivine, Fa17-19, average Fa18; pyroxene, Fs4-19, average
Fs10. The meteorite is tentatively classified as an H3 chondrite.

Find: July 1990
Pallasite
History: One stone weighing 198 kg was found by N. F.
Kharitonov at a shore of an artificial water reservoir, 27.5 km from the town
of Pallasovka. Interestingly, the town was named after Peter Pallas
(1741–1811), a famous naturalist who took part in the discovery and the first
study of the Pallas Iron Mass, which was found near Krasnojarsk in 1749 and
gave the name of the pallasite meteorite group. A. E. Milanovsky transferred a
sample of the meteorite to the Vernadsky Institute, Moscow.
Petrography and Geochemistry: (M. A. Ivanova, N. N.
Kononkova, Vernad; S. E. Borisovsky, Institute of Geology of Ore
Deposits, Mineralogy, Moscow)
Petrography: The stone consists of approximately
equal parts of olivine and metal, and has abundant brown, rusty fusion crust
with regmaglypts.
Geochemistry: Olivine (mg# 87.7, Fe/Mn = 45.2, Fe/Mg
= 0.14; similar to main group pallasites). Metal (bulk ICP AES) Ni = 13.1 wt%;
Ir = 0. 12, Au = 2.8, Pt = 3.2, Ga = 22.5, Ge = 24.9 (all ppm). Kamacite (Co =
0.61, Ni = 7.21; both wt%) and taenite (Co = 0.35, Ni = 26.5 both wt%).
Additional phases: Troilite (Ni = 0.41 wt%), schreibersite, and chromite (mg#
36; Fe/Mn = 48.9; Cr/(Cr+Al) = 77.2). Note: Chromites in this sample differ in
composition from that of the main and Eagle Station groups.
Classification: Pallasite (Main group).
Specimens: A 9336 g sample and one polished section
are on deposit at Vernad. The main mass is held by an anonymous
purchaser.

[Partial description by M. Zucolotto, edited by J. Grossman; complete writeup will be published in late 2009]]Among the Brazilian meteorites listed as “doubtful” in the British Museum catalogue is “Monte Alto”. The unconfirmed existence of an “aerolithe” in the region of Monte Alto mountain was first reported in a letter from priest José Dorme to the Museu Nacional and related by Orville Derby in 1888, in which he declared that the object was of the same nature of Bendego, however bigger than it.
In November, 2007, paleontologist Douglas Riff was led by archeologist Joaquim Perfeito to examine a strange rock at the entrance of a public school, named Marcelino Neves. Riff immediately noticed the similarity of this rock with the Bendego meteorite. It has a mass of 97 kg, and was found before 1954 by Mr. Francisco Cruz at the same site where the legendary meteorite, related by Dorme, was found. "

 by Jean-Jacques Corré at the Hotel des Ventes in Paris.
 The box was part of the estate of Jean Simon Colonna-Cimera, an ""Ingénieur des Mines,"" who supervised
 mines in foreign countries and in the French Colonies.
 Corré thought that the stone might be a meteorite but
 kept it for 7 years before attempting to have it
 identified. Physical characteristics: One complete, fresh stone
 weighing 1.370 kg and covered with a very black fusion
 crust (Fig. 6). Petrography: (M. Bourot-Denise, B. Zanda, MNHNP):
 The stone contains abundant metal and refractory
 inclusions up to 800 μm in size. The chondrules (up to
 1 mm in size) are well preserved, although their
 mesostases are altered to phyllosilicates. The finegrained
 matrix is heterogeneous and contains zones with
 abundant sulfides (pyrrhotite and pentlandite), zones
 with magnetites, and zones with PCPs. Geochemistry: Olivine (Fa0.2–55,
 CaO = 0.35, Cr2O3 = 0.35); low-Ca pyroxene (Fs0.6–4.4).
 Minor phases: kamacite (average: Ni = 5.5, Co = 0.22),
 tochilinite, pyrrhotite, pentlandite, magnetite (pure
 Fe3O4); calcite and PCPs (average: FeO = 52,
 SiO2 = 12, S = 9). (EPMA and expressed in wt%).
 Oxygen isotopes: δ18O=3.34‰, δ17O= -1.37‰. Classification: Carbonaceous chondrite (CM), no signs
 of terrestrial weathering or shock (chondrules are
 perfectly spherical). Chondrules are more abundant
 and phyllosilicates less abundant than in CM2s.
 PCP averages 4.51 for FeO⁄SiO2 and 0.77 for
 S⁄SiO2, well out of the ranges defined by Rubin et al.
 (2007), making Paris significantly less aqueously
 altered than any known CM2. Oxygen isotopes also
 place it toward the least hydrated end of CM
 chondrites. Specimens: The mass of 1.275 kg and one thin
 section are on deposit at MNHNP.Fig. 6. The Paris CM chondrite showing fresh fusion crustand interior."

Iron (IAB complex)
History: A small (18.4 g) end piece of a badly oxidized octahedrite was found in 1925 at the collection of the Escola de Minas Ouro Preto. In 1960 it was donated to Museu Nacional of Rio de Janeiro. The meteorite was mentioned in the British Museum catalog and the Handbook of iron meteorites of Buchwald, when it was named Patos de Minas (octahedrite), or Patos II, to distinguish it from Corrego do Areado, or Patos de Minas (hexahedrite). In 2002, a mass of about 200 kg was found by Paulo Garcia when plowing the land with a tractor.
Physical characteristics: One mass of about 200 kg has average dimensions of 54 × 33 × 22 cm. It is rough, elongated and very weathered, exhibiting some grooves due to terrestrial corrosion and with no signs of fusion crust. Description: Polished sections display a poor medium Widmanstätten structure of irregular kamacite lamellae 1.1 ± 0.2 mm (max. 2.4 mm), with the Widmanstätten pattern not very obvious. Aspect ratios (length/width) of individual lamellae range from 1 to 8, most being 4-6. Terrestrial corrosion penetrates to a depth of 5 cm. Troilite nodules are very common. The structure is identical to Patos de Minas (octahedrite) so the two masses are considered to be paired.
Geochemistry: (John T. Wasson, UCLA, data obtained by INAA). Bulk composition: Co = 4.8, Ni = 83 (both mg/g); Ga = 67, Cu = 240, As = 15.4, Ir = 1.3 and Au = 1.7 (all in µg/g).
Classification: Iron (IAB complex); very weathered
Type specimens: A total of 1200 g of sample is on deposit at Museu Nacional/UFRJ/Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The main mass was recently sold by the finder.

Classification: The stone is an iron of the IAB
complex, but it is not a member of the IAB main group or the subgroups. It is
closely related to Algarrabo and slightly further away in composition from
Livingston (Tennessee). The kamacite bandwidth is 0.9 ± 0.2 mm (medium
octahedrite). In some areas such bands have merged to create bands twice as
wide.
Specimens: A 23 g type specimen is on deposit at UCLA
and one 86 g type specimen is on deposit at ASU. The main mass is held

An iron of 72.52 g was found by a then eight-year-old boy,
Christian Couture, on a sand beach on the south side of the Penouille peninsula
(Baie de Gaspe), ~1 km south of the village Penouille. In 1994, he brought it
to the Planétarium de Montréal, where it was identified as a meteorite. The
iron has an oxidized, but smooth exterior with an ellipsoidal shape of 4.8 x 3

Classification: Ordinary chondrite (H5, melt breccia)
History: A mass of unknown original weight was found on a rock dump on agricultural land near the township of Pingrup. The meteorite was broken by the finder and a sample sent for assay. Subsequently, the stone was brought to the WAM.
Physical characteristics: The irregular, broken mass is deeply weathered and mantled in a crust of brown oxides and  oxyhydroxides of iron. The interior is dark and heavily stained with iron oxides.
Petrography: (A. W. R. Bevan, WAM) Microscopically there are few discernible chondrules. The stone is extensively shock-melted and abundant, large, blackened shock melt veins pervade the fabric of the meteorite. Vestiges of the original chondritic texture are also severely shocked. Most of the metal and troilite grains have been shock-melted and now occur as large Fe/FeS globules with a eutectic texture, some metal and troilite remain unmelted. Accessory minerals include chromite.
Geochemistry: (A. W. R. Bevan and P. Downes, WAM) Olivine Fa19.1; orthopyroxene Fs16.8Wo1.5; metal Ni=8.4 Co=0.46 (all wt %); chromite Cr# 83.8, Fe# 82.7.

Rio Grande do Sul, BrazilFound: 2005
Classification: Iron meteorite (IIIE)
History: A single mass weighing about 200 kg was found in the city of Porto Alegre. The finder, the date and the exact location are not known, but the discovery was made prior to 2005 based on a letter from Dr. Hardy Grunewaldt, who noted the meteorite during a visit to the Museum of Catholic University of Porto Alegre.  The current owner of the meteorite, Dr. Jeter Bertoletti, is the former director of the museum.
Physical characteristics: Severely weathered with no signs of the original shape and dimensions caused by mass loss from exfoliation. In samples examined at MNRJ, the corrosion has progressed so far that various fragments failed to disclose any unweathered material. Corrosion penetrates to the very center, particularly along octahedral planes, which make lamellar width measurements difficult.
Petrography: (M.E.Zucolotto, MNRJ) Etched preserved sections display a coarse Widmanstätten structure of swollen, short kamacite lamellae with an average width of 1.6 ± 0.3 mm. A wide zone of kamacite adjacent to taenite-plessite and phosphides are altered to oxides. The interior of some plessite fields are severely corroded showing a contrast between dark corroded alpha phase and bright preserved gamma phase. Weathering selectively attacks the nickel and phosphorous-depleted ferrite adjacent to the rhabdite precipitates that are very abundant in some kamacite lamellae. Taenite and plessite cover about 20-25% by area mostly as acicular, comb and dense martensitic fields.
Geochemistry: (J.T. Wasson, UCLA) Bulk composition (INAA): Ni = 90.2,  Co =4.96 (both mg/g); Cu = 146, Ga = 18.2,  As = 5.65,  Ru = 8.7, W  = 0.80,  Ir = 0.148, Pt  = 6.1, Au = 0.898, Cr = 71 (all ppm).
Classification: Iron, coarse octahedrite (IIIE), very weathered.
Specimens: A 20 g sample plus one polished thin section are on deposit at MNRJ. The main mass is with Dr. Jeter Bertoletti in Porto Alegre.

Physical Description: 
This sample is an iron meteorite with an ablation pitted
surface. Approximately one-half the specimen (north, east, and, bottom
hemisphere) is brownish-black with a metallic luster. This area appears to have
been polished by physical processes (wind ablation). The opposite hemisphere
(south, west, and top portion) is chemically weathered. The color of this surface
ranges from rust through gray to greenish. This surface is flaking.  Approximate
dimension of specimen: 20 cms diameter. The specimen appears to have been
partially buried at sometime. Several inclusions and voids where former
inclusions existed are present on the surface.
 
Tentative Classification: Roy S. Clarke,
Jr.
An area of approximately 80 cm2 of macroetched
surface was examined. Kamacite band widths are in the 1.5 to 2 mm range, with
length to width ratios ranging from 4 to 10. Neumann bands are abundant, and
the kamacite along about half of the rim of the slice has been converted to α2
by atmospheric ablation. Taenite and taenite-plessite areas occupy at least
half of the kamacite grain boundaries, and a number of areas of comb plessite
are present. Schreibersite is present in grain boundaries, and one area of
lamellar schreibersite surrounded by cohenite is present. Cohenite and
schreibersite are present at the edge of the slice in an area that may have
bordered a troilite inclusion. No large inclusions were observed. External
weathering of the specimen ranges from light to severe. The specimen is a
coarse octahedrite, a typical Group I or Og meteorite.

Macroscopic Description: René Martinez
Brown fusion crust which is spotted with oxidation haloes
covers 90% of this specimen. The interior surfaces are dark gray with black
inclusions as large as 2 mm in diameter. Oxidation is heavy along interior
fractures.
 
Thin Section (.7) Description: Brian Mason
The section shows a close-packed mass of chondrules (0.6-2.4
mm across) and irregular granular aggregates. Some of the chondrules have dark
rims consisting largely of fine-grained troilite. The sparse matrix is
fine-grained, with a small amount of coarser nickel-iron and troilite scattered
throughout. A notable variety of chondrule types is present; many are granular
or porphyritic olivine and olivine-pyroxene with transparent to turbid
interstitial glass. The pyroxene is polysynthetically twinned clinobronzite.
Brown limonitic staining pervades the section. Microprobe analyses show olivine
ranging in composition from Fa17 to Fa27, with a mean of Fa23 (CV FeO is 9.3);
pyroxene compositions range from Fs14 to Fs23. The meteorite is an L3 chondrite
(estimated L3.9); it resembles RKPA80256, and the possibility of pairing should
be considered.

Classification: Ordinary chondrite (H4)
History: Found by Brad Newman along an off-road trail within well-sorted sand, likely postglacial in nature.  The 223.7 g main mass was found first, followed by a 5.77 g fragment found within 2 meters of the main mass.  The smaller fragment fits into a hole in the side of the main mass.
Physical characteristics: The specimen is highly weathered, with a rusty exterior and penetrated by mm-scale fractures. In spite of the weathering, the specimen is an oriented individual. The fusion crust is preserved, and shows a ""rollover rim"" on the trailing edge.
Petrography: (C. Herd and B. Benoit, UAb) Consists of well-defined chondrules in a fine-grained matrix.  Chondrule textures include cryptocrystalline, barred olivine, radial pyroxene, porphyritic olivine, porphyritic pyroxene and porphyritic olivine-pyroxene. Chondrules range in size from 0.1 to 1 mm in diameter.  Some olivine grains display undulatory extinction. Brecciation is apparent in thin section. In hand specimen, fractures penetrate through the meteorite, and although obscured by weathering, some brecciation at this scale is apparent.  Metal is preserved between fractures.  A density of 3.13 ± 0.01 g/cm3, obtained by an archimedian method, is consistent with heavy weathering.
Geochemistry: Average olivine and pyroxene compositions (electron microprobe): Fa19.2±1.3 (PMD = 6.5); Fs16.2±1.5 (PMD = 8.9), Wo1.3±0.3.  Chondrule mesostasis augite of composition Fs6.2, Wo46.3 is also present.
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (H4), S2, W5.
Specimens: A total sample mass of 40.5 g including one thin section are on deposit at UAb. Main mass, B. Newman (St. Albert, Alberta).

Castilla-La Mancha, SpainFound: 1980
Classification: Iron meteorite (IAB-MG)
History: The specimen was discovered by Faustino Asensio López in 1980 at an agricultural farmland where he often worked with his father. The iron was found about 1.5 km from Retuerta del Bullaque, Ciudad Real, Spain, close to the northern boundary of Cabañeros National Park. The finder recognized the unusual density of the rock and found no crater. For more than fifteen years the meteorite remained on the family home patio, and later was used as a weight for the ham-curing process. Mr. Asensio López suspected an extraterrestrial origin of the specimen when he watched a TV news report on the sighting of a meteor over Spain on February 28, 2011, so later that year he contacted Juan C. Gutiérrez-Marco (CSIC-IGE) and Rafael P. Lozano (IGME) to check the authenticity of the specimen.
Physical characteristics: One mass of about 100 kg and average dimensions of 45 × 31 × 20 cm. Irregular but somewhat rectangular shape, with many concave surface features. The original surface shows moderate terrestrial weathering.
Petrography: (R.P. Lozano, IGME; J.C. Gutiérrez-Marco, CSIC-IGE). Two etched sections (77.7 and 41.1 cm2) show a Widmanstätten pattern (bandwidth: 2.0 ± 0.3 mm), with abundant cohenite lamellae (9.5% of total area), irregularly bordered by accessory schreibersite and enveloped in swathing kamacite. Taenite is present in 0.02-0.3 mm thick lamellae along kamacite and between kamacite bands (0.3-4 mm max. size pearlitic plessite). There are abundant kamacite grains showing polygonal sectors, with conspicuous Neumann lines and without cohenite. The larger sections display eight irregularly shaped graphite-FeS nodules (max. size, 5-12 mm), located in the central areas of the kamacite polygonal sectors. Each of the nodules has a 1-3 mm-thick rim of schreibersite + cohenite.
Geochemistry: (Jesús Reyes, IGME). Bulk composition: Ni = 7.527, Co = 0.475 (ICP-AES data, in wt%). Ga = 68.9, Ge = 365, As = 13.7, W = 0.95, Ir = 1.95, Au = 1.695 (ICP-MS data, in ppm).
Classification: (R.P. Lozano, IGME). Iron meteorite, coarse octahedrite, IAB complex (MG), cohenite rich, moderate weathering.
Specimens: A 1278 g type specimen, two fragments of 388 and 50 g, and three polished sections at IGME. The finder, F. Asensio López, and his brothers hold the main mass of about 98 kg.

Achondrite (eucrite, polymict basaltic)
History: A single stone was found in a deflation hollow (formed within a parabolic dune) during an expedition to the Pampean Plain of Argentina by P. A. Bland (ICL), C. R. de Souza Filho (UEdeC), and J. Coniglio (UNdeRC).
Physical characteristics: The 62.7 g meteorite is largely covered with a matte black, slightly weathered fusion crust. Broken surfaces and thin sections are bright gray in color with clasts clearly visible.
Petrography: (J. Levine, UChi; P. A. Bland, ICL) The meteorite consists of larger (up to 1 mm) mineral and lithic clasts set in a fine-grained matrix composed of 10–50 µm size plagioclase and pyroxene fragments. Polycrystalline clasts occur from a variety of sources, reflected in the large range of pyroxene compositions. Areas with fine-grained recrystallized melt are commonly seen. Pigeonite clasts with augite exsolution lamellae are observed. Larger fragments include plagioclase, Ca pyroxene, and basaltic clasts; plagioclase contains pigeonite and troilite inclusions. Accessory minerals, including olivine, troilite, spinel (mostly chromite), ilmenite, metal, and a silica polymorph, have been observed.
Mineral compositions and geochemistry: Plagioclase (An92.9; range An89.7–96.6), orthopyroxene (Fs37.2–77.1Wo0.3–4.8), pigeonite (Fs62.6–85.8Wo5.3–16.6), and augite (Fs35.4–72.6Wo21.3–43.5).
Classification: Achondrite (polymict basaltic eucrite).
Type specimen: 50.67 g is on deposit at UNdeRC. A 5.09 g specimen and polished thin section are on deposit at ICL. Fragments totaling 1.79 g, a polished thin section, and polished epoxy mount are on deposit at UChi."

Class and type: Stone. Olivine-bronzite chondrite (H5) (Olivine Fa20.1 by microprobe analysis)
Number of individual specimens: 1, now in three pieces.
Total weight: 103.3 g
Circumstances of find: One stone was picked up in a pasture in the southwest quarter of section 33 of township 22, range 4E, Manitoba (lat. 50°56.4'N; long. 96°59.5'W), about 7 km south of Riverton, Manitoba and about 2 km west of the western shore of Lake Winnipeg. The field has since been broken out and planted. The stone was first recognized by Glenn Huss in 1968, at which time it was in three distinctly weathered pieces weighing 76.2 g, 24.8 g, and 2.3 g. The first and third pieces are at the American Meteorite Laboratory, Denver, Colorado; the 24.8 g piece is now in the National Meteorite Collection, Ottawa. Examination of the latter shows it to be strongly fractured, with the metals oxidised to a considerable extent. Chondrules with typical textures are well preserved. The classification is based on microprobe analysis of 10 olivine crystals of uniform composition.

Volgograd region, RussiaFound: 3 Oct 2009
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (L6)
History: A single stone was found by shepherd A.G. Satkanov close to the Romashki and Prigarino villages of the Pallasovsky district in the Volgograd region.  The stone was partly exposed on the surface of a field. The sample was transferred to N.F. Kharitonov, the finder of the Pallasovka meteorite, who identified the stone as a meteorite. According to Kharitonov’s story, he observed a large fireball that was accompanied by a bright light and sounds over the Romashki-Prigarino area in 1971. Thus, he proposed that the stone could be related to that fireball.
Physical characteristics: One incomplete individual weighing 3400 g and 16x16x12 cm in size. It has a brown fusion crust, which is slightly oxidized. One side of the stone is chipped; the missing part was not found (15% or less in volume).
Petrography: (M. A. Ivanova, Vernad): The meteorite contains olivine, pyroxene, FeNi-metal, sulfides, chromites. Chondrules and their fragments are abundant (~80 vol%).  The chondrules range in size from 0.2 to 0.6 mm, 0.3 mm on average.  The chondrule margins are not clear and the meteorite contains  different textural types of chondrules including BO, POP, and PP.
Geochemistry: Mineral compositions and geochemistry: (Borisovsky S., IGEM): Olivine is Fa24.7, and low-Ca pyroxene is Fs20.8Wo1.62.
Classification:  The meteorite is an ordinary chondrite of L group and petrological type 6, weathering grade is W1, and shock stage is S3.
Specimens: A 682 g piece and one thin section are on deposit at Vernad. UHM holds the main mass of the meteorite.

Ordinary chondrite (L5/6) 
History: Mr. Bill Braggs found the sample May 1, 2005, while looking at cacti blooms ~¼ mile NW of Snyder Hill during a visit to a friend. The stone was found on the surface with no other rocks nearby. 
Physical characteristics: The meteorite is one complete stone weighing 31.8 g. It exhibits an irregular, angular shape with dimensions of 4 × 3 × 2 cm; >90% weathered, black fusion crust with rusty-orange patches. 
Petrography: (D. H. Hill, UAz) Chondrules range in size from 0.2 to 1.5 mm. They are mostly porphyritic and granular chondrules. Fragments of BO chondrules and a few RP chondrules are also observed. Chondrule outlines are visible but not well delineated. At least 30% of the matrix is recrystallized with chondrule boundaries not discernible. Metal and sulfide grains are ~1:1 in abundance and range from ~20–500 μm, except for one 1.3 mm metal grain. Many irregular melt pockets <40 μm across contain metal globules usually adjacent to metal grains. There is orange staining of silicates especially near metal grains. A clast, whitish in hand specimen, is composed of recrystallized material with no easily discernible chondrules and smaller metal grains than the main meteorite. 
Mineral compositions and geochemistry: Olivine (Fa 24.79% ± 0.57), pyroxene (Fs 21.15% ± 1.01), and kamacite (Co 0.79% ± 0.17) (EMPA). 
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (L5/6); W2, S4. 
Type specimens: Mass of 5.5 g and two thin sections are on deposit at UAz. B. Braggs holds 26 g (5731 N. 3rd Street, Phoenix AZ 85012). Main mass is on loan to the UAz Mineral Museum at UAz Flandrau Science Center. "

Two individual masses, 13.44 g
and 5.10 g, were found within 100 m of each other, in a dry streambed, by
Patricia and Gordon Cave who were prospecting for gold with metal detectors.
Both samples were recovered from 4-8 inches depth in soft, dry, desert soil.
Both are complete individuals with 2-3 mm diameter regmaglypt-like markings on
the exterior. Classification and analysis (D. Hill, LPL): The analyzed
sample is mainly kamacite with trace amounts (<<5%) of taenite and
schreibersite. No shock deformation is evident. Average compositions from
microprobe analysis are: Kamacite, Fe = 93.6 ±
1.4 %, Ni = 5.9 ±  0.6 % (n=536);
Taenite, Fe = 72.4 ± 5.8 %, Ni = 26.0 ± 5.9 % (n=111); Schreibersite, Fe = 44.7 ± 6.5 %; Ni = 40.7 ± 5.2 %; P = 14.3 ± 1.8
% (n=94). Width of cross section of a single kamacite lamella ~ 4.3 ± 0.5 mm. The larger, intact specimen
indicates octahedral structure with similar kamacite widths. No obvious
Widmanstatten structure is visible on the etched surface. Average bulk composition
of two replicate INAA samples from the smaller specimen: Ni 6.04 ± 0.06%; Ga 54.6 ± 0.5 μg g-1; Ge 190 ± 40 μg g-1; Ir 0.018
± 0.002 μg g-1;
Au 1.06± 0.01 μg g-1;
W 0.62 ± 0.03 μg g-1;
As 7.94 ± 0.11 μg g-1. 
Based on Ni and other elements, a IIAB designation is indicated, with a closer
agreement to IIB irons.  Comparisons of Au vs. Ga, Co, Ir exhibit concentrations
that are consistent with IIAB also but do not fall exactly along sample trends
noted by Wasson et. al (1998). Type specimens: 2.3 g LPL; 2.8 g + 13.44

Kansas, Johnson County, United StatesPurchased: 2010
Classification: Iron meteorite (IAB-MG)
History: A single 8181 g mass was acquired at an estate sale in Shawnee, Kansas. The meteorite had been used for many years as a doorstop by a couple that lived in Shawnee. The owners of the meteorite originally owned farm ground in Barton County, Kansas, but lived for the better part of their lives in Shawnee. Unfortunately, the exact find location is unknown. A small end piece was sent to ASU and confirmed to be a meteorite.
Physical characteristics: Surface shows some fusion crust and minor weathering with broad regmaglypts.
Petrography: (L. Garvie, ASU) Etched sections show a coarse Widmanstätten structure, with stubby kamacite, bandwidth 1.3 mm. Kamacite lamellae display subboundaries and numerous μm-sized phosphide precipitates. Sub-millimeter schreibersite common within some kamacite grains and at grain boundaries. Neumann bands straight and well developed in rhabdite-free grains. Thin taenite and plessite cover several percent by area. Inclusions common - one 7 × 5 cm slice exhibits several (to 2 cm) irregular silicate-graphite-troilite-schreibersite regions. Silicates consist of olivine, low-Ca pyroxene, clinopyroxene, and plagioclase. Slice contains several 1-mm blocky schreibersite with cohenite rims.
Geochemistry: Bulk composition: INAA data (Activation Laboratories - Ancaster, Ontario): Co 0.46 mg/g, Ni 74 mg/g, Ga 57 μg/g, Ge 180 μg/g, Ir 2.24 μg/g, and Au 1.50 μg/g.
Classification: Iron meteorite, IAB-MG, coarse octahedrite, moderately shocked.
Specimens: Type specimens - two slices with total weight of 144.6 g.

classified so far. Sinawan 001 consists of three large fragments of 8.2, 7.2
and 2.15 kg, resp., and numerous smaller fragments with a total weight of 11
kg, which were found within a distance of about 200 m. The larger fragments
have fusion crust only on one face. Fusion crust and interior are only little
weathered. The thin section shows shock veins and maskelynite. Sinawan 002 is a
rounded, complete individual with fusion crust, also only little weathered.

Ordinary chondrite
(L4) In late July 1997, Ismagil Gaysin and his son Radik were loading hay on to
a cart near Souslovo village, 10 km N of Birsk town. The cart was not safe on
the sloping track, and the father asked his son to find a stone to secure the
wheel. Radik found a stone buried in soil in the nearest ditch. When the work
was finished, they decided to bring the stone home because it had an unusual
color and shape. Later, they thought that the stone (weighing 19.3 kg) could be
a meteorite, and in 2002 sent a piece to the Vernadsky Institute, Moscow for
identification. In 1966 March 30, 15:45 UT, a bright fireball was observed in
the region and it could be that the meteorite find might be related to the
fireball. Classification and mineralogy (S. Afanasiev, Vernad): olivine,

Texas, USAFound: 1950
Classification: Pallasite (Main group)
History: A single mass weighing 1724.8 grams, and displaying regmaglypts and some remnant fusion crust, was found ~1950 by a farmer while plowing. Several months later, the finder took the specimen to Texas Tech University where it was classified by a mineralogist Mr. Dennis as a "" stony iron siderolite - variety pallasite"".  Decades later, after watching a television show on meteorites, the son of the finder took the specimen to Dr. Laurence Garvie at the Center for Meteorite Studies, ASU for further study. The pallasite was later purchased by Ruben Garcia and Geoff Notkin.
Physical characteristics: Single, fragmental piece with a few patches of remnant fusion crust. Greenish olivine crystals protruding from the surface. Small area of farringtonite visible at the surface. Weathering is minor and restricted primarily to small areas at the edge of the stone.
Petrography: (L. Garvie, ASU). A 12 × 6 cm polished and etched slice shows (areal %): swathing kamacite 39.8, plessite 20.0, olivine 36.2, troilite 1.9, schreibersite 1.1, and farringtonite 0.9. Olivine grains are typically well rounded and <1 cm, though some are angular. Swathing kamacite, to 1-mm thick, well developed, some areas showing prominent Neumann bands. Many of the plessite fields show well-developed kamacite laths.
Geochemistry: (J. Wasson, UCLA; L. Garvie, ASU) Metal composition by INAA (mean of two analyses) Ni 117 mg/g; Co 5.75 mg/g, Cu 316 μg/g, Ga 18.5 μg/g, As 26.5 μg/g, Ir 0.076 μg/g, and Au 2.727 μg/g.  EMPA of 13 separate olivine grains gave Fa17.5±0.1, FeO/MnO=54.6±4.7, Cr2O3=0.03±0.01, n=19.  Based on the elemental composition and the high olivine Fa content the meteorite appears to be unpaired with other known pallasites.
Classification: Main-group pallasite.
Specimens: 141 g at ASU.

History: A single stone was found by B. Crawford while he was prospecting. The stone was found within 4 km of the site of recovery of the Warden meteorite (MetBull 69)
Physical characteristics: (A. W. R. Bevan and P. J. Downes, WAM) The stone is an irregular, rounded mass weighing 2.7 kg and measuring 16 × 12 × 10 cm. The surface is 80% covered with fusion crust. Where the interior is exposed, it is iron stained and fresh metal particles are visible.
Petrography: (A. W. R. Bevan and P. J. Downes, WAM) Microscopically, recognizable chondrules, including barred olivine, porphyritic olivine and radiating pyroxene types, are set in a microcrystalline matrix. Accessory minerals include troilite, kamacite, taenite, tetrataenite and chromite.

Find: September 2004 
Ordinary chondrite (L/LL5) 
History: A girl of age 12, Katarzyna Dępczyńska, found the stone in gravel on a road about 100 m from the house no. 73 in the village of Święcany, Jasło district, Podkarpackie province, Poland. The gravel was probably brought from a quarry near Skołyszyn in 2003. The stone was then given to Mr. Marcin Mazur from the town of Jasło, who gave it for examination to Mr. Łukasz Bandur, student of geology, who found it was a chondrite. Then the stone was given for classification to Dr. Łukasz Karwowski USil. 
Physical characteristics: It is an 8 g rusty stone with tiny grains of quartz and argillaceous slate stuck to its surface and rare fragments of fusion crust. 
Petrography: (Ł. Karwowski USil) Metallic Fe-Ni is replaced by iron oxide except a few tiny taenite grains. Troilite is largely weathered. Iron hydroxides and the remaining metal and troilite comprise 5–6 vol% No alteration of silicates. There are few well-delineated chondrules and many chondrule fragments. Matrix is composed of olivine and pyroxene grains, some of which are quite large, comparable with chondrules in size (up to 1.5 mm). The stone is brecciated. 
Mineral compositions: Olivine (Fa25.3–26.4), low-Ca pyroxene (Fs22.0–22.8), high-Ca pyroxene (Fs7.0–7.0 Wo46.5–46.5), feldspar (An10.4–13.9 Or4.4–6.3). 
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (L/LL5); S2, W3. 
Type specimens: One thin section and the main mass, 6.62 g, are on deposit at USil. "

Carbonaceous chondrite (equilibrated CR-like meteorite) or primitive achondrite 
Twenty-six pieces with a total weight of ~110 kg were found by Bernard Dejonghe on an ancient alluvial plain. The two largest weigh ~30 kg each. Twenty stones were found on a trip in early 2000, and six more in 2001 March. The geographic coordinates of these meteorites are being withheld by the finder for three years. Classification (M. Bourot-Denise, MNHNP): Fa29.3, pyroxene Fs24.3; ~30 vol% millimeter-sized relic chondrules are clearly visible in backscattered electron images. Textures and relative abundances of the phases vary considerably.  The dominant lithology has a coarse grain size. It consists of olivine (poikilitically enclosed within pyroxenes in the relic chondrules), a small amount of plagioclase, 10% metal in rounded or oval-shaped grains often edged by chromite, and minor sulphides in small grains. The interchondrule matrix consists of subhedral crystals of olivine embedded in plagioclase and within anhedral crystals of chromite and phosphate that are up to 1 mm in size. Two distinct plagioclase compositions are present: An46.4Or2.2 in the matrix and An26.6Or5.2 in chondrule relics. A second lithology is finer grained and porous, without large metal grains but with fairly abundant sulphide grains. The large metal grains are composed of kamacite (6% Ni, 0.6% Co) and martensite (12% Ni, 0.4% Co). Some smaller metal grains associated with sulphides are made up of taenite (up to 36% Ni, 0.2% Co) with martensite cores. The sulphide is troilite (Cr 0.02–0.08%), with some grains containing inclusions of Cu-bearing pentlandite. See also Bourot-Denise et al. (2002). Bulk chemistry (J. Zipfel and B. Spettel, MPI; H. Palme, Köln): refractory lithophiles fractionated compared to a typical CR composition, leading to possible classification as a primitive achondrite (Zipfel et al., 2002). Oxygen isotopes (M. Javoy, IPGP): δ17O = +0.18 ± 0.08‰, δ18O = +2.94 ± 0.2‰. Weathering grade, W0/1; shock stage, unknown. Specimens: type specimen, 396 g plus five polished sections, MNHNP; main mass partly left in Niger, partly with the finder. 
A 3.61 kg stone, labeled ""Te-1"", was found in 2000 March, probably on the same expedition noted above, and is reported by J. Otto (Frei) to have been found in the Tenere Desert at 20°45.8' N, 10°26.5' E. Classification (J. Otto and A. Ruh, Frei): a primitive achondrite; partly covered with black fusion crust; shows a recrystallization texture with abundant 120° triple junctions dominated by olivine (56 vol%, 100–700 µm, Fa28.7, 0.06 wt% CaO) and poikilitic orthopyroxene (23 vol%, up to 3 mm, Fs25.4Wo3.6) with exsolved clinopyroxene (Fs12.7Wo39.7); Fe-Ni metal is irregulary distributed (~10 vol%, up to 5 mm); poikilitic plagioclase occurs in interstices (6.5 vol%, An38.5Or3.7); troilite (~3.5 vol%, 0.01 wt% Ni); chromite (~1 vol%, Fe/(Fe + Mg) = 0.817, Cr/(Cr + Al) = 0.818). Oxygen isotopes (R. Clayton and T. Mayeda, UChi): δ17O = -0.85‰, δ18O = +1.70‰, different from other achondrites.  Noble gases (L. Schultz, MPI): data compatible with those of brachinites; exposure age is ~45 Ma. Shock stage, S1/2; weathering grade, W0.

Classification: Iron meteorite (IIAB)
History: Two metallic masses of 16 g and 25 g were found ~15-30 m apart by Mr. Joe Adams using a metal detector, on a grassy, partly forested hill top ~4.3 km southwest of the town of Tamarack, Idaho. Both individuals were completely buried in soil at depths ?1 cm. The smaller individual (measuring ~3 x 1 x 1 cm) was donated to Cascadia and was used for petrographic and geochemical analysis.
Physical characteristics: (A. Ruzicka, Cascadia): The individuals are similar-appearing iron meteorites with prominent regmaglypts and are largely coated by reddish rust stains and a dull brown weathering patina. They have blacker edges and corners (apparent fusion crust) that show exposed metal from the interior at abrasion points.  Owing to their proximal recovery locations, similar burial depth, and similar appearance in hand specimen, the individuals are probably paired.
Petrography: (S. Kissin, LHU; A. Ruzicka, Cascadia):  Microscopic examination of cut, etched faces reveals primarily kamacite. The apparent bandwidth is ~3 mm, although the specimen observed is too small to obtain a precise bandwidth measurement.  Kamacite contains Neumann lines and numerous rhabdites.  No traces of a heat-affected zone are preserved in the interior. Microhardness measurements yielded VHN = 208 (mean of 3 measurements, range 202-213), indicating moderate work hardening.
Geochemistry: (S. Kissin, LHU; A. Ruzicka, Cascadia): INAA was performed according to the methods of Wasson et al. (1998) at Activation Laboratories (Ancaster, Ontario), irradiating polished cubes of ~0.4 g and ~3.2 mm thick. This yielded the following elemental concentrations (all units µg/g except where noted): As (10.4), Au (1.09), Co (5.03 mg/g), Cr (20), Cu (103), Ga (74), Ge (370), Ir (0.044), Ni (58.6 mg/g), Pt (4.6), Re (<0.01), Sb (<20), W (<10).  These data suggest a Group IIAB designation, although concentrations for Ga and Ge are high relative to other IIAB irons of the same Au content by ~30% and ~230%, respectively, most likely due to analytical error.
Classification: Iron, coarsest octahedrite (IIAB)
Specimens: 14.2 g derived from the smaller sample is available as a type specimen at Cascadia. The owner holds the main mass.

Classification: HED achondrite (Diogenite)
History: A Moroccan meteorite hunter (Dhamen Ouled Ali) looking for pieces of the Erg Chech fall (Chergach) found this 23 kg single stone by chance, 15 km north of the Taoudenni salines.
Physical characteristics: One single 24,370 g stone, with patches of fusion crust (5 to 10 % approximately). log χ = 2.8.
Petrography: A. Jambon, O. Boudouma, D. Badia, UPVI, studied one polished section by EMPA and SEM. The meteorite has a cumulate texture, dominantly orthopyroxene, with minor amounts of poikilitally enclosed olivine and chromite/pyrrhotite and interstitial plagioclase and chromite. Rare silica and kamacite (mostly weathered) occur. A few clusters of subhedral olivine are irregularly distributed (according to photographs of the whole stone).

History: Tieret 001 is one of seven meteorities found in a new dense collection area.  From 21 to 26 February, 2009, seven meteorites (ordinary chondrites) ranging in mass between 10.6 and 602 g, and totaling 703.2 g, were recovered during a Tunisian-Italian meteorite search campaign in southern Tunisia (Tieret 001-007).  Members of the Tunisian party were N. Ouazaa, S. Kassaa and M. Ghanmi (Tunis); members of the Italian party were N. Perchiazzi (UPisa), A. Zeoli and L. Folco (MNA-SI) and P. Rochette (CEREGE). The seven meteorites were found on the rocky desert plateaus (regs) of the Tieret region, which mostly consist of upper Cretaceous sedimentary rock sequences (see also Laridhi Ouazaa et al. 2009). The Compagnie Générale de Géophysique--Veritas Services Tunisie (CGG-Veritas) provided logistic support. LF was supported by the EC through the ORIGINS project. "

Mesosiderite
History: A small impact structure about 3 m in diameter was found in the vicinity of the village of Toufassour (Tata, Morocco). A number of stones have been collected since 2003 by nomads and sold to dealers in Erfoud. In particular two stones totaling 3 kg and a number of fragments were sold by one nomad, but the most significant mass (an ~70 kg stone) was found by a woman hunting for meteorites. More recently many small stones were collected by Moroccan scientists (IZU. Agadir) around the impact structure: Three pieces of 61.0, 15.5 and 13.1 grams and fragments ranging 1 to 5 grams, totaling about 320 grams. Total mass exceeds ~73.3 kg. 
Physical characteristics: The fusion crust is absent and the surface appears dark brown. Larger nodules of metal protrude here and there, and larger inclusions of silicates are seen, as greenish spots. Many of the smaller specimens were rich in metal, the phase, which best resisted weathering. 
Petrography: (A. Ibhi and H. Nachit, IZU, and A. Jambon, O. Boudouma and D. Badia, UPVI) Mode (wt%): kamacite and (minor) sulfide, (partly oxidized) = 27, pyroxene = 56, plagioclase = 20, silica = 5, and chromite = 0.9. Rutile and schreibersite are also present. 
Mineral compositions and geochemistry (EMPA): Pyroxene FeO/MnO = 27, En70Fs26Wo4 to En59Fs33Wo8. Chromite Cr/(Cr + Al) = 0.76. Plagioclase Ab7, An93. Kamacite, Ni = 6%. Merrillite contains significant amounts of MgO. 
Classification: Mesosiderite. Moderately to significantly weathered, depending on the grain size. 
Type specimens: 2 polished thin sections and 89.6 g at IZU, one polished thin section and 22 g at UPVI. An anonymous dealer holds 300 g. "

Classification: Enstatite chondrite (EL6)
History: Ms. O'Connell and Mr. Doherty found the meteorite while looking for Indian artifacts in a cultivated field on his family farm, a recorded Archaic site (22Le1064). Ms. O'Connell spotted it and showed it to Mr. Doherty who realized that is was unlike the stone tools that had been found there. Web research then led them to believe that it was a meteorite.
Petrography: (H. McSween, UTenn) The meteorite is an enstatite chondrite, composed of abundant chondrules, with significant amounts of Fe/Ni metal and sulfides.  The only silicate phase is enstatite (En98, homogeneous, as determined by electron probe), and no olivine has been found.  Most of the chondrule outlines are obscured by metamorphic recrystallization.  Analyses of Si and Ni in kamacite, partitioning of Ni between phosphide and kamacite, Ti and Cr in troilite, and Mn, Fe, and Mg in alabandite all confirm that the meteorite is an EL6 chondrite (Zhang et al., 1995).
Specimens: 20 g at AMNH, 0.2 g at UTenn, main mass with finder.

Twannberg 47°05.73′N, 7°09.45′E 
Twannberg, Canton of Berne, Switzerland
Find: 1984
Iron (IIG)
History: Two additional masses of Twannberg were recovered in 2000 and 2005, in both cases in non-natural settings indicating earlier collection. Mass II (2246 g) was found in August 2000 in the attic of an old house (Dorfgasse 7) in the village of Twann by Marc Jost. Mass III (2533 g) was identified in September 2005 in a rock and mineral collection deposited at NMBE as a permanent loan from the Museum Schwab, Biel, Switzerland, where the sample was originally labelled as “hematite,” probably around 1932. Both secondary find places are in the vicinity (3.5 and 5 km distance) of the original find locality.
Physical characteristics: (B. Hofmann, NMBE) Both newly recovered masses are of irregular elongated shape, and are covered by an oxide rind several millimeters thick, with abundant incorporated terrestrial silicate sand grains corresponding to local glacial till deposits of the Rhône Glacier. Similar sand grains were also observed in the oxide rind of the first mass.
Petrography: Both new masses show a texture identical to the first mass. Large schreibersite crystals (up to 4 cm in length) are enclosed in kamacite. Fracturing follows thin (10– 20 µm) plates of rhabdite present in up to 10 different orientations.
Mineral compositions and geochemistry: (J. Wasson, UCLA) Analysis of mass II (INAA data) yielded values very similar to those reported for the first mass: Ni = 46.7, Co = 5.17 (both mg/g); Ga = 37.3, As 18.0, Ir 0.101, Pt 1.0, Au 1.406 (all g/g).
Classification: Iron (IIG). Pairing of the two new masses with Twannberg is supported by identical mineralogy and texture, oxide rind petrography including nonmeteoritic silicate grains and bulk chemistry.
Type specimen: The majority of the original mass (10,536 of 15,915 g) and both newly recovered masses are located at NMBE. The total known mass of Twannberg now is 20,694 g.

[From MetBull 94]Three small masses have turned up in 2007, bringing the total known mass to 20.771 kg

 [From MetBull 95]Erratum for Twannberg: the total weight is 20.689 kg."

Antofagasta, ChileFind date unknown
Classification: Iron meteorite (IIAB)
History: The seller stated that a woman found the meteorite on a path after seeing a fireball but the moderate weathering is inconsistent with this scenario. The location was between Antofagasta and the Andes. The name Uasara means desert in the Aymaran language spoken by the Aymara people of the Andes.
Petrography: (J.T. Wasson, UCLA) Two polished and etched specimens were examined; they show mottled textures with tiny (~0.1 mm) light and dark ""stars"", apparently the result of shock followed by reheating. There are compositional halos around sulfides and phosphides. One edge of the sample shows thick flow features that may have originated during atmospheric passage. One edge of the sample shows a very ragged oxidize surface with many pock marks. There are tiny (0.2- 1 mm) holes that pass from this surface into the polished and etched face 1 to 2 mm from the edge of the specimen. Rhabdites are small but common, typical of low-Au IIAB irons.
Geochemistry: 4.45 mg/g Co, 55.5 mg/g Ni, 59.5 μg/g Ga, 178 μg/g Ge, 3.76 μg/g As, 48.2 μg/g Ir, and 0.479 μg/g Au. All elements are within the fields defined by IIAB irons. The Ir content puts the meteorite near the high extreme where it joins two other irons from N. Chile, Sierra Gorda and Negrillos.
Classification: Iron, IIAB.  This mass may be paired with Sierra Gorda or Negrillos or both.  Given the uncertainty in the discovery location of the new iron, it may have been found near Sierra Gorda but the (poorly defined) location of Negrillos is 340 km distant from Sierra Gorda. The composition of the new iron is slightly closer to that of Negrillos. Because of uncertainty in the pairing, it is being treated as a new iron.

Ordinary chondrite (H5)
History: One stone of the meteorite was found by S. G. Bildzyukevich in the Zavolzhsky District of Ulyanovsk, in a vacant lot near the intersection of Antonov and Ulyanovsky Avenues. A part of the meteorite was sticking out of the ground by ~2 cm and was thus polished by tires of cars going to the nearby repair shop. A sample of the meteorite was given to the meteorite collection of the Russian Academy of Sciences by members of the Russian Society of Meteoritical Admirers, D. A. Kazakov and Dr. A. K. Stanyukovich.
Physical characteristics: One 4680 g sample with a polyhedron shape, 16 × 16 × 12 cm in size. The surface was slightly covered by iron hydroxides.
Petrography: (Lorenz C. A., Ivanova M. A., Vernad.) The meteorite contains olivine, pyroxene, FeNi-metal, sulfides, chromites and abundant (~80%) chondrules and their fragments. The chondrules range in size from 0.2 to 0.7 mm in apparent diameter to 0.3 mm. The chondrule margins are not clear and the meteorite contains a large variation in the textural types of chondrules including BO, PO, POP, and PP.
Geochemistry: (Ivanova M. A., Vernad.) Olivine (Fa17.9) and orthopyroxene (Fs16.1Wo1.2).
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (H5); S3, W2.
Type specimens: A total of 960 g of sample and one thin section are on deposit at Vernad. D. A. Kazakov, A. K. Stanyukovich, and S. P. Vasiliev hold the main mass.

Achondrite
(eucrite) 
Fragments of a
single 470 g stone were found by Steffan Hatlestad, a 12-year-old boy, while
walking in the mountains.  Mineralogy and classification (G. Raade, UOslo):
the meteorite is a breccia with relic primary gabbroic textures. The main
minerals are plagioclase (with undulatory extinction) and pyroxene (low-Ca
pigeonite). They occur as angular clasts (0.05 to 0.7 mm) in a fine-grained
groundmass; subrounded pyroxene grains may be up to 1.2 mm. Rounded clasts 2–3
mm in size show coarse ophitic to subophitic (gabbroic) textures. Accessory
minerals are silica, ilmenite, titanian chromite, and troilite. Isolated
plagioclase clasts and plagioclase laths from the larger, gabbroic clasts have
similar composition, An86 (mean of three analyses). Low Ca-pyroxene
has a composition of Fs59Wo2. Exsolved augite lamellae
vary in composition from Fs26Wo44 to Fs31Wo36.
Scanning an exsolved pyroxene grain gave a bulk composition of Fs44Wo21.
The host pyroxene has small inclusions of troilite, ilmenite, or plagioclase.
Weathering grade:  W0. Chemical composition (G. Raade, UOslo): SiO2

Classification: Iron meteorite (IIIAB)
History: Meteorite purchased from a person from Patagonia who stated that it had been found on a farm near Villa Regina by a relative.
Petrography: (J. Wasson, UCLA): Observations based on 37 × 26 mm slab, 4 to 6 mm thick, etched on all cut surfaces. Om; bandwidth 0.8±0.1 mm. Heat altered zone ~2 mm wide on outer surfaces.  Small FeS nodules, only 8 mm2 in a total area of about 2100 mm2. No schreibersite was identified. Structure is deformed and fractured. Weathering is minor.
Geochemistry: Co = 5.01 mg/g, Ni = 79.3 mg/g, Ga = 19.3 μg/g, Ge <70 μg/g, As = 4.30 μg/g, Ir = 4.32 μg/g, Au = 0.598 μg/g.
Classification: Iron, IIIAB. The composition of Villa Regina puts it in all IIIAB fields on element-Au diagrams. Its nearest relatives are Mount Wegener and Ssyromolotovo, but it is resolvable from these in terms of Ir and they were found on different continents.  It is thus not paired with any other iron.

Blaine County, Oklahoma, USAFound: 1950-1960
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (LL3.1)
History: The seller discovered the stone in the weight box of a disk plow used by his father in the 1950s-1960s. He believes his father found the stone while plowing and placed it in the weight box. The stone possesses a nick where it was likely hit by the plow. The stone was unlike others in the weight box, which prompted the seller to save it for several years until finally bringing it forward for identification.
Physical characteristics: A single 21.0 × 17.1 × 10.8 cm mass weighing 5025 g. Black fusion crust up to ~0.7 mm thick  covers ~70%. The surface is otherwise smooth, dark brown, rust-marked, and pitted in places where inclusions (not chondrules) weathered out. White inclusions and light beige inclusions up to 2.5 cm are visible on the surface, though none are present in the few cuts made from the stone. The stone is highly oriented, possessing the smooth, ballistic shape of a flattened nose cone, and a sharply flat truncation on the bottom of that shape.
Petrography: (D. London, UOkla): PP/CP chondrules are round, sharp in definition, averaging ~0.8 mm in diameter, and comprising ~60-80 vol% of the stone.
Geochemistry: (D. London and G. B. Morgan VI, UOkla): Olivine; range (64 analyses) is Fa0.8-42.5, average (sd) Cr2O3 content (wt. %) of ferroan grains (9 chondrules) is 0.39 (0.15). Average composition (wt.%) of metal in chondrules is: (1)  Fe-rich,  95.19±1.19 Fe, 3.72±0.79 Ni, 0.36±0.05 Co, 0.13±0.13 Cr, 0.06±0.12 P, and (2) Ni-rich, 51.37±6.34 Fe, 48.17±5.83 Ni, 0.08±0.06 Co, 0.11±0.12 Cr, 0.02±0.02 P. Average composition of metal in matrix is: (1) Fe-rich, 93.57±2.37 Fe, 4.11±0.46 Ni, 1.93±2.37 Co, 0.06±0.06 Cr, 0.04±0.09 P, and (2) Ni-rich, 52.35±3.95 Ni, 46.13±4.04 Fe, 0.90±0.40 Co, 0.02±0.02 Cr, 0.01±0.01 P.
Classification: (D. London and G. B. Morgan VI, UOkla; M. Weisberg, KCCU): LL3.1,S2, W2: classification as LL is based on (1) low modal abundance of metal, 0.05 vol%, as measured by threshold (gray-level bin sorting) of a BSE mosaic that covered 35% (~2 × 0.4 cm) of the surface area of the existing sample; and (2) mean chondrule size of ~ 0.8 mm. Petrographic classification is based on Cr content of high-Fa olivines.

Find: 2 November 2006
Ordinary chondrite (H5, breccia)
History: The stone lay on sand close to dunes at the northwestern boundary of the Badanjilin desert. H. Zang recovered the stone on the way from the base to Weikengquan.
Physical characteristics: The stone is 665 g, roughly ball-shaped and ~10 cm in diameter. It has a complete fusion crust with many cracks penetrating inside. Sand grains adhere on the crust.
Petrography: (Y. Lin, B. Miao and S. Hu, IGGCAS) It is a brecciated chondrite, consisting of numerous almond-like clasts cemented by fine-grained impact melt. In the clasts, chondrules are readily recognized, and there are much more abundant troilite than metallic Fe-Ni. In the melt breccias, metallic Fe-Ni and troilite occur as small spheres, and there are nodule-like clasts with ringwoodite rims and wadsleyite interior.
Mineral compositions: Olivine (Fa19.4±0.4) and low Ca-pyroxene (Fs17.1±0.2) are homogeneous, but plagioclase shows variation (An11.7-20.6Ab69.8-85.5Or1.5-10.6).
Magnetic susceptibility: log χ (in 10-9 m3/kg) 4.45.
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (H5, breccia); S6, W3.
Type specimens: A sample of 359 g is on deposit at IGGCAS. The finder holds 306 g."

Iron, medium octahedrite (IIIAB) 
History: Four small fragments were found buried adjacent to a circular depression by two local residents using a metal detector. The circular depression was subsequently confirmed as a 36 m diameter Late Holocene impact crater based on morphology, identification of impact ejecta and crater fill, and presence of impact melt (C. Herd and D. Froese, University of Alberta), and further fragments were recovered. 
Physical characteristics: The meteorite consists of 74 samples with a total mass of 5372 g. The samples were found buried up to 25 cm and have a red-brown exterior. 
Petrography: (C. Herd, University of Alberta, UAb) Widmanstätten pattern with an average bandwidth of 0.8 ± 0.2 mm and areas of plessite are evident on polished and etched surfaces. Locally, kamacite lamellae are coarser and taenite lamellae are offset as a result of shock deformation and recrystallization. Rare Fe-Ni phosphide inclusions are present. 
Mineral compositions and geochemistry: Bulk composition: INAA data (J. Duke, UAb): Ni = 8.11 ± 0.13 wt%, Co = 4950 ± 100 μg/g, Ir 10.3 ± 0.5 μg/g, (uncertainties 1σ, 68% confidence level), Ge ≤ 40 μg/g, indicate the IIIAB group. 
Classification: Iron, IIIAB medium octahedrite, extensive shock, moderate weathering. 
Type specimens: A total of 2.4 kg is on deposit at UAb. The remainder of the known material is held by the anonymous finders. "

Ordinary chondrite (H3.5, breccia) 
History: The stone was found by Steve Humeston in an area covered with sand, scattered rocks and sparse native vegetation. 
Physical characteristics: A single stone of 552 g was recovered. It was completely covered with fusion crust. 
Petrography: (A. Rubin, UCLA) Chondrule outlines are well defined; there has been little integration between chondrules and matrix. Some chondrules contain glassy mesostases. The rock has been shocked; olivine grains exhibit undulose extinction under crossed polarizers in the petrographic microscope; the olivine grains contain planar fractures in their crystal structure caused by shock. The rock is moderately weathered; between 20% and 60% of the metal grains have been at least somewhat oxidized. The rock is also a breccia. It contains a clast that has experienced more significant shock than the host; much of the metal and sulfide in the clast was melted and mobilized by shock. The boundary between the clast and the host is sharp. 
Mineral compositions and geochemistry: The rock is unequilibrated with a large range in olivine composition (Fa 12.8–30.9 mol%, n = 13). The mean Fa content is 20.9 ± 4.7 mol% and it has a percent mean deviation (PMD for Fa) of 17.2. 
Classification: Ordinary chondrite (H3.5 breccia), S3, W2. 
Type specimens: A total sample mass of 30 g is on deposit at UCLA. The remaining mass of 472 g is in the possession of the finder. "

History: Several large, fractured and broken, crusted masses and many smaller fragments totaling more than 30 kg were found scattered on the surface over a large area near Windimurra Station. The first find was about 3 km N of Kantie Murdana Hill.
Physical characteristics: (A. Bevan, WAM). Some fragmental material retains fresh, black fusion crust. Chondrules are clearly visible on broken and cut surfaces. Fresh metal (with only very minor oxide staining) and discontinuous, elongated, thick (up to 2 mm) metal veins are also evident on some sections.
Petrography: (A. W. R. Bevan, WAM, and A. Tomkins, Monash). Chondrules with devitrified mesostases are well pronounced. Chondrule types including porphyritic olivine, porphyritic pyroxene, barred olivine, radiating pyroxene and cryptocrystalline, occur in a generally microcrystalline matrix. In some pyroxene chondrules, grains of polysynthetically twinned clinopyroxene occur. Metal grains are heterogeneously distributed and large metal grains and metal and troilite veins locally invade the fabric of the meteorite. A large elongated clast of dark, fine-grained H-group material was observed in one section. Accessory minerals include chromite.
Geochemistry: (A. W. R. Bevan and P. Downes, WAM). Olivine Fa19.7±0.3; low-Ca pyroxene Fs17.8±0.4Wo0.36-1.3; chromite (in the H-group clast), Fe# 85.0, Cr# 85.1; kamacite, Ni=6.8,  Co=0.50 (both wt.%).

Macroscopic description
 
This is a subrounded stone. A small patch of shiny black fusion
crust remains on one plane surface. Exposed interior shows fine-grained
granular texture. Thick (2 mm) black shock vein penetrates the stone.
 
Petrographic Description
 
The section shows a typical poikilitic texture. Large
oikocrysts of pyroxene enclose olivines and oxide minerals. Minor maskelynites
are observed. Low-Ca pyroxene has a mean composition of Fs23.1Wo3.6.
Olivine has a mean composition of Fa32.6. Mean composition of
maskelynite is An56.9. The oxygen isotopic composition (analyzed by
I. Franchi) of a bulk rock sample that is δ18O=4.129, δ17Ο=2.446,
Δ17O=0.299, indicates that the meteorite is martian origin.
